            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:107489:3"/> with rancid Oyl: I knew not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that you and I were ſo famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly acquainted, and it may increaſe your wonder to find your <hi>Name</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sermons preach'd at their <hi>Funerals,</hi> whoſe very Names 'tis like you never heard before.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, I acknowledge I have much cauſe to wiſh the <hi>Preſent</hi> I make you, were more proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to your <hi>Ladyſhips</hi> merit, and more worthy your Acceptance, but the leſs it deſerves, the more it needs the ſhelter of ſuch a <hi>Patronage,</hi> and how mean, and even affectedly plain, ſoever the manner of handling them is, the Truth and Duties treated of are of great concern and moment, and highly uſeful and neceſſary; and though as to the main, they come too late, (which is your <hi>Ladyſhips</hi> Praiſe and Happineſs) to aſſiſt and direct you; your <hi>early Piety,</hi> and <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Vertue,</hi> being already ſo far advanced, in what they are deſigned to excite in others: Yet they may

            </p>
            <p>As to the ſecond, tis true the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of printing them is wholly owing to <hi>two Funerals,</hi> but this was meerly <hi>accidental,</hi> for they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted from me, by thoſe who were indeed <hi>Auditours</hi> at Church, but not Gueſts at the Funeral, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have diveſted them of that <hi>Character,</hi> by omitting the <hi>Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi> I then gave to the Memory of <hi>my Friends,</hi> that that might give no <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion</hi> to the main Deſign.</p>

            <p>But <hi>Madam,</hi> I fear your <hi>Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips</hi> quicker thoughts will ſtart a third Objection, more difficult than either of the former; that is, ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect I deal with you, like ſome <hi>non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvent Debtor</hi> with his impatient Creditor, deſign to while you off with this poor Trifle, inſtead of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Debt you have ſo long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and ſo often demanded, that is, the fuller Account of the Life of your <hi>incomparable Aunt,</hi> and the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of her <hi>excellent Papers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Madam,</hi> I muſt own my ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to your <hi>Ladyſhip</hi> in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, as alſo to the Expectations and Deſires of many other worthy perſons, to whom the ſhort Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs annexed to her <hi>Funeral Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> have been ſo uſeful, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo acceptable. And therefore I ingeniouſly confeſs, I think my <hi>beſt Plea</hi> will be to plead guilty of too much Delay, though I want not juſt Excuſes to alleviate the Fault: but I rather chooſe to renew my
<pb facs="tcp:107489:4"/> Promiſe of the ſpeedyeſt <hi>Diligence,</hi> when this ſmall Work hath paſt my Hands, to <hi>reaſſume</hi> and finiſh what I had ſo many Months ſince made a good Progreſs in, and by Gods Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and Aſſiſtance ſhall draw the Portracture of that great <hi>modern</hi> Pattern of <hi>Piety,</hi> out of her own Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers; ſhewing the Steps by which, and Method in which that <hi>bleſſed Saint</hi> arrived at that eminent Height, in the power of Godlineſs, and kept her ſelf in the Love of God.

            <p>IT will, 'tis like, ſeem ſtrange to you, that I ſingle out theſe plain <hi>Sermons</hi> to be made publick, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than any of thoſe many I have delivered to you in the long courſe of my <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> and ſome of which 'tis
<pb facs="tcp:107489:5"/> poſſible you may judge more worthy of the Light, and would have rather cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen for your Uſe; It is fit therefore I give you an <hi>account</hi> of the Publiſhing theſe. Let me therefore firſt aſſure you, it was not <hi>Originally</hi> my own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination which led me to it, but the earneſt Intreaties of others.</p>
            <p>And how <hi>ſtale</hi> ſoever this Pretence is, yet when ever it is true and real, (as 'tis very much ſo in my preſent Caſe) it retains its weight, and is a juſt <hi>Apology,</hi> at leaſt as much as ſuch an Undertaking needs.</p>
            <p>Being ſent for in the latter part of the laſt <hi>Month,</hi> to Preach a <hi>Funeral Sermon</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> for a very kind and worthy Friend, I was deſired by one of his neer Relations to Print it, which I reſolvedly refuſed; requeſting and obtaining to be excuſed, without <hi>Unkindneſs</hi> or <hi>Offence</hi> taken. But though I had ſilenced the <hi>firſt</hi> Motion, I found it harder to reſiſt a <hi>ſecond,</hi> for before I left the City, I was ſet upon by one, who heard <hi>Occaſionally,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:107489:6"/> as not Concerned in the Funeral, who preſt me with ſo much earneſtneſs in his own Name, and as he told me, in the <hi>Name</hi> of many others who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged him in it, for the <hi>firſt,</hi> and in Diſcourſe, for the <hi>ſecond</hi> alſo, Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the ſame <hi>Church</hi> upon the like <hi>Occaſion,</hi> ſome while ſince, adding an <hi>Offer</hi> to pay the <hi>Charge</hi> of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, which though kindly meant, I judged indecent to accept of. We par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without my yeilding farther, or promiſing more than that I would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of it: which ſome days after my Return I did accordingly.</p>
            <p>In this <hi>Deliberation,</hi> I well knew the plainneſs of theſe <hi>Sermons,</hi> and how unfit they are to bear their Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, whom nothing <hi>pleaſes</hi> but height of <hi>Phanſy,</hi> ſublime <hi>Notions,</hi> and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laborate <hi>Periods.</hi> On the other ſide I could not deny the <hi>Weight</hi> of their honeſt Argument, who deſired to have them. <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Benefit</hi> they reapt by hearing them, and the deſire and hope that themſelves with many others
<pb facs="tcp:107489:6"/> might reap more by reading them. Hereupon I thought the <hi>Hazard</hi> of my Reputation, (as to Eloquence and Learning) was but a ſmall Stake to be ventured againſt the hopes of doing good to Souls, and might be ſafely ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured, and would be <hi>profitably</hi> loſt, if the other were attained and won. And for the <hi>probability</hi> of that I concluded the Judgment of the Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers was not to be deſpiſed; For if our <hi>Church</hi> allow, (as it doth allow) a Judgment of Diſcretion to private Men in greater Matters, much more may they claim it in what ſo neerly concerns themſelves: as to know what moſt Convinces, Inſtructs, Affects, and edifyes them.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, I confeſs, the <hi>Preacher</hi> beſt knows what Pains and Study his Compoſures coſt him, and is highly concerned not to do Gods Work negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, nor offer to him what coſt him nothing, yet for all that, the <hi>Hearers</hi> beſt know what ſinks deepeſt into their Hearts, and moſt powerfully awakens
<pb facs="tcp:107489:7"/> them, and draws them from Sin to God. As the <hi>Cook</hi> may beſt compute the Charge in the <hi>Kitchin,</hi> and what Coſt and Art was beſtowed in dreſſing of the <hi>Feaſt,</hi> yet the <hi>Gueſts</hi> at the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble are better <hi>Judges</hi> what pleaſes their Pallates, agrees with their Stomachs, and by an eaſy Digeſtion turns to good Nouriſhment, and miniſters both <hi>Health</hi> and <hi>Strength,</hi> as that often doth, which wants the higheſt Seaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Plain and honeſt <hi>Chriſtians</hi> like their Spiritual Food never the worſe, though it be not diſguiſed like an <hi>Oleo</hi> or French Diſh, till they cannot know what's ſet before them. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> who had good <hi>Skill,</hi> as well as good <hi>Authority</hi> in theſe Matters, exhorts us to ſtrive to <hi>Excell,</hi> to the edifying of the <hi>Church,</hi> rather than to be <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians</hi> to our Hearers, and leave them ſo to us, though they ſhould admire us much, for underſtanding us little, or not at all.</p>
            <p>When ſuch Thoughts as theſe, had inclined me to <hi>Gratify</hi> the deſires of
<pb facs="tcp:107489:7"/> the <hi>two</hi> former, I concluded to add the <hi>third,</hi> which had been acceptable to ſome of your ſelves. And I hoped they all together might be uſeful to you, for whoſe Sakes I chiefly eſteem myſelf to <hi>live</hi> and <hi>work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Scope and Subſtance of them all, is ultimately the ſame, and like Lines drawn from diſtant and oppoſite Poynts, they touch and end in the ſame Centre, againſt <hi>Procraſtination,</hi> or delaying a ſound and thorough Turning unto God. And indeed this is ſo uſeful and neceſſary a Point, that there is no String I have ſo often toucht upon in my <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> and have had I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, ſome remote Thoughts of <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing</hi> for your Benefit, no leſs than <hi>twelve Diſcourſes</hi> upon ſeveral Texts, handling the ſame Deſign with great Variety, even as theſe <hi>three</hi> do at preſent.</p>
            <p>And I will neither be afraid, nor aſhamed to Whiſper to you, though ſome over-hearing me ſhould make a bad uſe of it, what hath cauſed me to
<pb facs="tcp:107489:8"/> bend my Miniſtry ſo frequently this way.</p>
            <p>When I had been ſome time enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the <hi>Sacred Office,</hi> (though I began neither haſtily nor early) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, I hope from <hi>God,</hi> a great ſence of the <hi>Weight</hi> of that Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on my Heart, and deſire to do good to Souls, and being conſcious to myſelf of my <hi>Inabilities,</hi> amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Means I uſed to acquire ſome Sufficiency, one was to enquire of the moſt Learned, Grave, Conſcientious, and Experienced <hi>Miniſters</hi> for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; and one Query I propounded was, what <hi>Subjects,</hi> or what <hi>Texts,</hi> they had found moſt uſeful, and moſt ſucceſsful, to Awaken, Convince, and Convert their Hearers. To which a very Holy, Learned, Aged, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced <hi>Miniſter</hi> replyed, by naming a Text againſt <hi>Procraſtination;</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding he never found his <hi>Miniſtry</hi> ſo ſucceſsful upon any, as upon that <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> upon which very Text I have preached many Sermons ſince, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb facs="tcp:107489:8"/> any with more Approbation or Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, and I humbly hope not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Benefit</hi> to many Souls. This was the firſt Occaſion which led me to ſo frequent Preaching upon <hi>Texts,</hi> from whence I might pertinently preſs you to ſpeed in the Work of God, and to diſcover the Sin and Danger of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay.</hi> But I have had two great <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments</hi> ſince to confirm me in this Practice; the one from a great <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,</hi> the other from a very comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table <hi>Experience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Example</hi> is that of the never enough Celebrated, Apoſtolical Divine and <hi>Preacher,</hi> the Holy and Bleſſed <hi>Archbiſhop Uſher,</hi> who in thoſe <hi>uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sermons,</hi> preacht at <hi>Oxford,</hi> though Printed but from imperfect Notes, taken from his Mouth, and now in the <hi>laſt Edition</hi> added to his <hi>Sum</hi> and <hi>Subſtance</hi> of Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, in which he ſeems to deſign a gradual chaining ſuch <hi>Texts</hi> together, as may bear <hi>Diſcourſes</hi> tending to lead men from a State of <hi>Nature,</hi> through
<pb facs="tcp:107489:9"/> Grace to <hi>Glory</hi> begins with <hi>Heb. 4.7.</hi> He limiteth a certain Day, <hi>ſaying to Day,</hi> &amp;c. Upon which he hath two Sermons Intituled <hi>ſpeedy Converſion,</hi> the only means to prevent <hi>Imminent Deſtruction,</hi> as if he had told them all his following Labours would be <hi>loſt,</hi> and do them no good, if they did not yield firſt to caſt off their <hi>Delays,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> is from my own <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,</hi> the moſt ſignal <hi>Seal</hi> and <hi>Crown</hi> God ever vouchſafed to honour my <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry</hi> by, being gained in the preſſing the ſame <hi>Argument.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I tell you with <hi>innocent Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> to beget in you an eſteem of this <hi>Subject,</hi> men ſeldom profiting by what they undervalue. And though <hi>God</hi> confines us not to one <hi>Subject</hi> (nay ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects we reveal to you the whole <hi>Counſel</hi> of his Will) much leſs confines him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but works by what <hi>Inſtruments</hi> he pleaſes, and by what <hi>Tools</hi> he pleaſeth in their Hands, yet a good <hi>Opinion</hi> of the <hi>Medicine</hi> helps the <hi>working,</hi> and is half a <hi>Cure,</hi> and we like a <hi>Remedy</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:107489:9"/> that carries a <hi>Probatum eſt,</hi> hath been approved uſeful. There's more hope that may help us, which hath been help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful unto others; 'Tis good being in <hi>Gods Way,</hi> and not only our <hi>Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> may be raiſed, but our <hi>Faith</hi> ſtrengthened for receiving good by thoſe Means, by which others have received it already.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:107489:13"/> contributes to that good Work, than a ſerious preparedneſs of Heart on the part of the Hearers: and on the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, a Word ſeaſonably fitted to the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion by which God calls them to attend to it. And if any thing next to the Grace of God, can awaken men, to awful Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of the World to come, 'tis convincing Evidence of their uncertain Continuance in this World: and unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able neceſſity of their certain Departure out of it.

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:107489:13"/> The Work on my part is to render my Diſcourſe ſutable. That the <hi>Ordinance</hi> we are exerciſed in, may anſwer the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> which brought us to it. That there may be an <hi>Harmony</hi> in the parts which are to be joyned into one piece. For God hath two <hi>Books,</hi> one of his <hi>Works,</hi> another of his <hi>Word.</hi> Both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> xix. and we are to turn a <hi>Page</hi> in either of them: To learn a Leſſon in the <hi>School</hi> of Nature, and in the <hi>School</hi> of Grace. And I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire theſe may anſwer each other, as the <hi>Windows</hi> did in <hi>Solomons Temple,</hi> Light over againſt Light.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Text,</hi> our <hi>Leſſon,</hi> or if you will our <hi>Sermon,</hi> from the Book of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, is not only to view a man like our ſelves, <hi>Mortal</hi> and actually <hi>dead:</hi> But a man, not paſt the vigour of his years and ſtrength, and t'other day in perfect health ſummoned to his <hi>Tryal,</hi> to ſtand at Chriſt's <hi>Tribunal,</hi> to receive his final doom and ſentence. And I think no <hi>Text</hi> in Scripture <hi>Ecchoes</hi> more vocally to this than the words I have read. <hi>Be ye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Ready alſo.</hi> The <hi>illative Particle, therefore</hi> hath an aſpect alſo on the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text,</hi> and it looks both backward and forward, to what went before in the 37.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:107489:14"/> and 39. <hi>verſes,</hi> and what follows after in this.</p>
            <p>In the Verſes pointed at, before the <hi>Text,</hi> are laid down, the bleſſedneſs of the ready, and the miſery of the unready. Rewards and Puniſhments are the <hi>Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of Government. Hopes and Fears are the Spurs and Bridles to quicken to <hi>Good,</hi> to reſtrain from <hi>Evil.</hi> Therefore if you would injoy the <hi>Good</hi> 'tis Natural to hope for and deſire, or eſcape the <hi>Evil</hi> 'tis Natural to fear and fly from. <hi>Be ready.</hi> The bleſſedneſs of the <hi>ready</hi> is deſcribed by the honour every ſuch ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant ſhall receive from his Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter when he comes, <hi>He will gird himſelf, and make them ſit down to meat, and come forth and ſerve him.</hi> And for greater aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, like <hi>Pharaohs dream,</hi> 'tis doubled, <hi>v.</hi> 37. begins <hi>bleſſed are thoſe ſervans,</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 38. ends <hi>bleſſed are thoſe ſervants.</hi> The miſery of the not <hi>ready</hi> is deſcribed by the condition of an Houſholder ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by <hi>Robbers,</hi> who break through his Houſe, with the ſuppoſed conſequences take away his Goods and Life, ſo that the ſum is, ſeeing ſuch <hi>ready</hi> ſervants ſhall aſſuredly be <hi>bleſſed.</hi> And ſuch unprepared Houſholder ſhall be miſerably <hi>ruined.</hi> Let others happineſs be your incouragement.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:107489:14"/> And let others harms be your warnings that ye be <hi>ready.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the duty is of ſuch vaſt importance that 'tis preſt yet farther with a <hi>Reaſon</hi> at the back of it. <hi>For the ſon of man cometh in an hour when ye think not.</hi> 'Tis the <hi>Motto</hi> and brand of a <hi>Fool</hi> to ſay <hi>non putaram,</hi> I never thought of this, excuſs therefore this <hi>ſtupidneſs,</hi> ſhake off this <hi>folly</hi> and bethink your ſelves, there's no <hi>watch</hi> in the night, there's no hour in the day when Chriſt may not come, therefore be ever preparing and prepared to meet him.</p>
            <p>I have thus brought the occaſion and the Text together; and led you through the Context to the Words, as clearly and as briefly as I could. So that nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains but to make the beſt improvement of them that I can. <hi>Be ye ready.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, 'Tis <hi>vox Reſpectiva.</hi> The very word implies a reſpect to ſomewhat. He that is <hi>ready,</hi> is ready for ſome perſon or ſome thing. And 'tis ſo obvious the naming of it is next to needleſs. 'Tis for the <hi>coming of our Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, 'Tis <hi>vox Praeceptiva.</hi> 'Tis a word of command from our Great Lord and Maſter, making that our duty, which is our greateſt intereſt and happineſs.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:107489:15"/>
            <p>Thirdly, 'tis <hi>vox Directiva.</hi> Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting us to that, in which our true our only wiſdom, which makes wiſe unto <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> doth conſiſt.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, 'Tis <hi>vox Comprehenſiva</hi> a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry large and comprehenſive word in two regards, firſt, including all things which concern our being Good and Happy. For to be <hi>ready</hi> for Chriſt, implies our being compleat in Chriſt. There's a receiving fulneſs of Grace from him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It implies our going to Heaven with him. <hi>For they that were ready went with him in to the marriage,</hi> Matth. xxv. 10. there's our happineſs.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It comprehends all perſons, <hi>ye,</hi> that's all: this indefinite is Univerſal: as, <hi>Thou,</hi> in the Commandments is every one: So here <hi>Ye</hi> ſignifies <hi>All.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe put together fall naturally and without any ſtrayning into this Doctrine.</p>
            <p>'Tis every mans indiſpenſible Duty and higheſt Intereſt to be preſently Ready for Chriſts coming. A Principle of Duty to Gods Authority requiring it. And a Principle of Wiſdom for our ſafety ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitating it; are the two unſhaken <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars</hi> on which this Truth is ſo firmly built, that it can never be moved. No <hi>Cavils</hi> from men or Devils can overturn it; no
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:107489:15"/> evaſion can ever diſpence with mens Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to it. But as long as man is bound to do what God bids. Or believe what God tells him. As long as 'tis the part of a wiſe man to eſcape the utmoſt miſery, and to deſire and perſue after infi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ite happineſs and glory. So long will this truth abide more fixed than the <hi>Earth.</hi> Yea eſtabliſht in (and as) the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Heavens.</hi> So that I ſhall ſay no more for its confirmation in this place, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, 1. To ſhew wherein this <hi>Readineſs</hi> conſiſts. 2. What is required on our parts to attain to it. 3. Preſs the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance with moſt cogent Arguments.</p>
            <p>But becauſe a wiſe <hi>Builder</hi> will carry off the Rubbiſh, and clear his Ground be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he lays his Foundation, I ſhall</p>
            <p>Firſt, Negatively ſhew you wherein <hi>Readineſs</hi> doth not conſiſt, or what is not ſufficient to make you ſo. And this is very needful to be done, becauſe <hi>prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion</hi> of the mind by error, hinders the Truth from entring, and leaves no room in the Heart to entertain it. And too many are prone to reſt ſatisfied with that which will deceive them, ſuppoſing 'tis enough to make their condition ſafe and happy, and would go farther, did they not verily think they had gone far
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:107489:16" rendition="simple:additions"/> enough. Many ſaith <hi>Seneca</hi> had become <hi>wiſemen,</hi> had they not thought themſelves already ſuch. And <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> the greateſt hindrance of proficiency, is an <hi>Opinion</hi> of ſufficient proficiency. 'Tis no wonder thoſe <hi>Marriners</hi> ſtrike Sail, who think themſelves in ſafe Harbour. Nor that he ſets by his <hi>Staff,</hi> and takes up his reſt who verily believes, he is at the end of his journey.</p>
            <p>Now, to paſs by the <hi>excuſes,</hi> many make for neglecting to be <hi>ready,</hi> there ſeem to be ſix things which men are prone to truſt to, as ſufficient to make their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition good and ſafe, which really are not ſo. 1. Their being born of <hi>Godly Parents.</hi> 2. Being of very <hi>good Natures,</hi> or ſweet Diſpoſitions. 3. Being <hi>Baptized</hi> and uſing and injoying the means of Grace. 4. Outward <hi>Conformity</hi> to the Letter of the Law in the practice of <hi>Moral Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues</hi> and Duties. 5. Being of the true <hi>Church,</hi> or of ſuch a <hi>Party</hi> or perſuaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 6. Believing in <hi>Chriſt</hi> or preſuming rather that they do ſo, without thoſe Fruits which prove their Faith to be Holy and Lively. It would require more time, than our preſent ſtreights will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, to ſpeak fully to all theſe, it muſt ſuffice to Nonſuit every of theſe <hi>Pleas,</hi> in a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:107489:16" rendition="simple:additions"/> word, to undeceive thoſe who are prone to deceive themſelves with <hi>ſhaddows,</hi> and <hi>appearances,</hi> inſtead of <hi>Realities.</hi> For 'tis an <hi>error</hi> very incident to weak and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial minds, (as we are all prone to be partial to our ſelves) to judg every thing which is good, to be enough, and good enough. Which is a great miſtake as you may be eaſily convinced, by a plain <hi>ſimilitude.</hi> Your <hi>mony</hi> may be very good, both for <hi>Mettal</hi> and <hi>Stamp,</hi> and as cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant as any in the Kingdom. Yet twenty Shillings of ſuch mony will not pay a Debt of ten pounds. What's the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? Not becauſe the <hi>mony</hi> is not good: but becauſe there is not enough of it. So in our preſent Caſe, theſe things I have named will not make us <hi>ready</hi> for Chriſt, why ſo? Not becauſe they are not <hi>good</hi> in their <hi>place</hi> and <hi>kind,</hi> they are good in <hi>tanto,</hi> but not in <hi>toto,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not good enough In <hi>degree</hi> and <hi>meaſure.</hi> Therefore I beſeech you think not I condemn or diſpraiſe them; or diſcourage your attainment of them. I only warn you not to reſt in them as ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, to make you ready for Chriſt, or fit to go to <hi>Heaven.</hi> For this they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do.</p>
            <p>Firſt, not the being born of <hi>Godly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:107489:17"/> tho it is a great mercy to be ſo, and is attended with many <hi>advantages,</hi> and many have put confidence in it. How often do we hear it from the <hi>Jews</hi> mouths <hi>we are</hi> Abrahams <hi>ſeed,</hi> we have <hi>Abraham to our Father,</hi> John viii. 43, 39, and St. <hi>John Baptiſts</hi> warning them againſt it, <hi>think not to ſay within your ſelves we have</hi> Abraham <hi>to our Father,</hi> Matth. iii. 10. intimates their hearts were full of it, and placed much confidence in it. But our <hi>Saviour</hi> tells thoſe very men <hi>John</hi> viii. 44. <hi>Ye are of your Father the Devil.</hi> And St. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> call theſe <hi>a generation of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.</hi> 'Tis not generation from the beſt men, but regeneration from the good Spirit, muſt do our buſineſs, <hi>non naſcimur, ſed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

As Circumciſed <hi>Iſraelites</hi> begot children which needed <hi>Circumciſion.</hi> And the beſt dreſt <hi>Wheat</hi> grows up again with <hi>Chaff.</hi> So thoſe whoſe Parents were <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed</hi> in heart, come into this world with a <hi>Foreskin</hi> on their hearts, which muſt be taken off. Whatever becomes of the diſpute of the <hi>Original</hi> of the <hi>Soul.</hi> 'Tis without diſpute that <hi>Grace</hi> in the Soul is not by <hi>traduction</hi> but by <hi>infuſion</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition.</p>
            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:107489:17"/>
            <p>Secondly, Not <hi>good Nature,</hi> or the ſweeteſt diſpoſition. I deny not but there is a vaſt difference betwixt the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of men. As great as any thing can make, but the Soveraign Grace of God. Some are ſuch <hi>Iſhmaels,</hi> ſuch <hi>Nabals, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligulas.</hi> Others ſuch <hi>Jonathans, Titus</hi>'s the <hi>darlings</hi> and <hi>delights</hi> of mankind. So ſweet, ſo affable, kind, obliging, ready to good, that nothing below the <hi>Image</hi> of Chriſt is more lovely than the impreſs of ſuch a temper. But ſtill the beſt of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is but Nature, and the Fruit of the <hi>unp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>un'd Vine</hi> will be but <hi>wild Grapes,</hi> and by Nature we are all <hi>Children of Wrath.</hi> Not Sons of God or Heirs of Heaven.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Not being <hi>Baptiſed,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying and uſing all the means of Grace. I tell you therefore firſt 'tis a very great Mercy and Favour of God to allow thee theſe <hi>priviledges.</hi> I tell you ſecondly, 'tis thy duty, and thou doſt very well to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend conſtantly on them, 'tis well thou wert <hi>Baptized,</hi> thou doſt well to hear the the Word, pray to God, keep thy Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet I tell thee thirdly, thou mayeſt go to <hi>Hell</hi> after all this, yea and have a hotter place there, than one of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> than the men of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> who never heard of, or
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:107489:18"/> injoy'd ſuch things. Nay I tell thee fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, 'tis one of the commoneſt, and moſt dangerous practical errors of them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Church,</hi> to think to <hi>Compound</hi> with God, and excuſe themſelves, for the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of the <hi>Duties</hi> thoſe <hi>Priviledges</hi> oblige them to, by a formal uſing of theſe <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges.</hi> And therefore there is nothing in which the <hi>Scriptures</hi> are more expreſs and copious, than in warning men againſt this <hi>miſtake.</hi> And that both in the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> and <hi>New. Jeremiah</hi> tells them, <hi>they truſted in lying words, who cryed the Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord.</hi> And continued in their ſins. <hi>Jer.</hi> vii. 4. to the 12. and Chap. ix. 26. He levels <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> for being <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſed in heart</hi> with <hi>Egypt, Ammon,</hi> and <hi>Moah,</hi> who were <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſed in Fleſh.</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you read with attention, yea with fear and trembling the ſecond Chapter to the <hi>Romans,</hi> eſpecially from the 17. verſe, and you will find that <hi>Circumciſion</hi> may become <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion,</hi> and ſo <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi> as no <hi>Baptiſm.</hi> And that he is not a <hi>Jew, who is one outwardly, but he that is one inwardly. And Circumciſion</hi> which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits is not the <hi>outward</hi> in the <hi>Fleſh</hi> and in the <hi>Letter:</hi> but in the <hi>Heart</hi> and in the <hi>Spirit.</hi> And St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells expreſly that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:107489:18"/> the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> which ſaves is not the <hi>waſhing of the fleſh:</hi> but when we can <hi>anſwer with a good Conſcience</hi> the queſtions uſually propounded in the Adminiſtration of it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> iii. 21.</p>
            <p>So for Prayer: <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſuppoſes they may make <hi>long Prayers,</hi> whoſe <hi>hands are full of blood.</hi> And <hi>David</hi> that ſome mens <hi>Prayers may be turned into ſin.</hi> And <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> tells you that the <hi>Prayer of the wicked,</hi> and of him that <hi>turns away his ear from hearing the Law, ſhall be abomination.</hi> The blind man <hi>John</hi> ix. 31. could ſee the truth, that <hi>God heareth not ſinners,</hi> ſuch as allow themſelves in ſin. And <hi>David</hi> ſaith of himſelf, <hi>if I regard iniquity in my heart God will not hear my Prayer.</hi> If thou haſt <hi>gifts</hi> to Pray like an <hi>Angel,</hi> and yet liveſt like an <hi>Incarnate Devil,</hi> thou mayſt indeed be Gods <hi>remembrancer.</hi> But 'tis but to put him in mind to take <hi>vengeance</hi> on thee. As the <hi>Philoſopher</hi> ſaid ſmartly to the wicked <hi>marriners,</hi> who began to Pray when a ſtorm aroſe. Hold your peace, hold your peace, for the Gods will certainly deſtroy us, if they take notice you are hear. Not that I would diſcourage a <hi>Simon Magus</hi> to Pray to God. <hi>Acts</hi> viii. 22.

            <p>So for <hi>Hearing,</hi> Rom. ii. 13. <hi>Not the hearers of the Law, are juſt before God, but the doers of the Law ſhall be juſtified.</hi> For <hi>whoſoever heareth Chriſts ſayings, and doth them is like to a wiſe man who buildeth his Houſe upon a Rock.</hi> But he that <hi>Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and doth them not is like a fooliſh man which builds his Houſe upon the Sand, and when the Floods beat upon it, it will fall, and great ſhall be the fall of it.</hi> Matth. vii. 24, 27.

The Stairs are the means by which you aſcend to your Lodging Chamber, but if any man ſhould therefore ſtrip himſelf and lye down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Stairs, he might find both a cold and hard Lodging, how warm and ſoft ſoever the Bed is which ſtands in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he Chamber at the Stairs head.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Not outward Conformity to the Letter of the Law, in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of <hi>Moral Vertues and Duties.</hi> Not but that this is very amiable and very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and curſed be the man that will diſpence with himſelf or others to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:107489:20"/> it: and it cannot, without great ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, or greater malice be charged on any, becauſe they ſhew the inſufficiency of this, and urge you to more. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly honeſt man</hi> is half a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.</hi> But I declare <hi>a Godly Knave</hi> is a whole one.

And will neither know nor do the eaſieſt.</p>
            <p>A ſober and honeſt Converſation in the fight of men is a <hi>fair body</hi> of a Chriſtian but there muſt be a <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liven it, as he ſaid to him, who won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:107489:20"/> that a <hi>Statue</hi> with ſuch perfect li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neaments, could neither go nor ſtand. <hi>Deeſt aliquid tnius.</hi> There wants a <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Principle</hi> within. <hi>With the putting off the Old man according to the Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and putting on the new,</hi> there muſt be <hi>a renuing in the Spirit of the mind,</hi> Eph. iv. 23.

We muſt add <hi>Faith</hi> to our <hi>Vertue,</hi> as well as <hi>Vertue</hi> to our <hi>Faith.</hi> See that you do the <hi>great things of the Law,</hi> but beſure you <hi>leave not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done the greater things of the Goſpel.</hi> A lively work of Faith to purifie your hearts, unite you to Chriſt, and make you partakers of his Spirit for ſound Regeneration, and through Converſion, without this you are undone for ever.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Not being of the true <hi>Church,</hi> or of this or that <hi>Party</hi> or <hi>Perſuaſion.</hi> 'Tis a wonder ſo many ſhould be cheated with ſo groundleſs an error; not only <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who have an <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> which tempts them to it, That the <hi>Faith</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>Treaſury</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi>

But I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you take notice. 'Tis not being of the trueſt and beſt <hi>Religion</hi> in the world will ſave you, but being true to that <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> and living up to it. <hi>Salvation was of the Jews.</hi> Theirs was the Religion God diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penc'd Salvation in, yet all <hi>Jews</hi> were not <hi>ſaved. All are not Iſrael who are of Iſrael, nor all the children of</hi> Abrahams <hi>Faith, who were the children of his fleſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Surely <hi>Judas</hi> was of the true <hi>Church,</hi> when he was of our Lords own <hi>Family;</hi> and yet went thence to his <hi>own place,</hi> a place to which you would be loath to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him. Be thy head never ſo <hi>Orthodox,</hi> as to the <hi>Articles,</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> if thy life be <hi>Hetrodox</hi> as to the Rule of Practice; the goodneſs of thy <hi>Faith</hi> will be ſo far from excuſing the badneſs of thy <hi>Life,</hi> that it will greatly aggravate thy Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and the more clearly thou knoweſt thy <hi>Maſters will</hi> and the more firmly thou <hi>believeſt</hi> it, with <hi>more ſtripes ſhalt thou be beaten for diſobeying it.</hi> Tho <hi>bad Company</hi> oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions many mens <hi>damnation,</hi> and <hi>good Company</hi> may be an <hi>help</hi> to; yet never was

            <p>Laſtly, Not believing in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or preſuming rather they do ſo, without any <hi>Fruits</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> to prove it true and lively. God forbid I ſhould make any ſiniſter reflections on the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of our <hi>Church,</hi> and a <hi>Doctrine</hi> ſo clear in <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi> as that of the <hi>Juſtification</hi> and <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> of ſinners by <hi>Faith</hi> in Chriſt, yea by <hi>Faith</hi> alone. God who <hi>regarded the lowlineſs of his hand maid,</hi> when his Son was Conceived: hath had regard to this humble lowly Grace, as to the Concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Chriſt in our Hearts. <hi>That Chriſt may dwell in your hearts by Faith.</hi> 'Tis ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to receive Chriſt Jeſus, and to make us the Sons of God by ſo doing. And <hi>whoſoever believes in him ſhall not periſh but have everlaſting life.</hi> John iii. 16. I know no other way of Salvation for my ſelf; I teach no other way to you, yet after all, I ſay to you, look well to your ſelves, that your <hi>Faith</hi> be <hi>Faith</hi> indeed, not a <hi>dead faith,</hi> not a bold preſumption, not a ſelf deluſion.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:107489:22"/> The ſtronger and purer the <hi>Liquor</hi> is with which the <hi>Poyſon</hi> is mixed, the more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous will its <hi>Operation</hi> be. I fear the <hi>Poyſon</hi> the <hi>Devil</hi> infuſes in this Holy, this pure Doctrine of the Goſpel, kills mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes for want of caution. I beſeech you therefore be very cautious leſt you be deceived in your Faith. The queſtion is not whether <hi>Faith</hi> will ſave thee and makes thee <hi>ready</hi> for Chriſt. But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou indeed have <hi>Faith</hi> that is true <hi>Faith.</hi> 'Tis certain <hi>Faith</hi> alone <hi>juſtifies</hi> a ſinner: but as certain, that that Faith which is alone <hi>juſtifies</hi> no ſinner. The <hi>Eye</hi> alone ſees. The <hi>Hand</hi> alone works; but if the <hi>Eye</hi> or <hi>Hand</hi> be alone, that is, ſeparated from the Body, they neither ſee nor work. Tho <hi>Faith</hi> juſtifies us as a paſſive Grace receiving Chriſt, and the gift of Righteouſneſs by and with him; and <hi>Sanctifies</hi> as an active Grace; yet 'tis the ſame <hi>Faith</hi> that doth both, and if it do not both, it will do neither. With the ſame <hi>Hand</hi> we receive what is given us, and with the ſame <hi>Hand</hi> we work what is injoyned us. The ſame <hi>Faith</hi> that receives Chriſt as a <hi>Saviour,</hi> engages you to ſerve him as your <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>King.</hi> And the ſame <hi>Faith</hi> which juſtifies your Perſons, muſt <hi>Sanctifie</hi> your Natures,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:107489:22"/> Act. xxvi. 18. <hi>And purifie your hearts,</hi> Act. xv. 9. <hi>And work by love,</hi> and make you <hi>new Creatures</hi> in Chriſt, 2 Cor. v. 17. if it <hi>ingraft</hi> you into him; and will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain you to live to him, if you do in good earneſt <hi>believe</hi> he dyed for you; and if your <hi>Faith</hi> have not theſe <hi>Fruits</hi> to prove it true and living, it makes you not <hi>ready</hi> for Chriſt, thou rather <hi>dreameſt</hi> thou <hi>believeſt</hi> in Chriſt; than doſt ſo real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and whilſt thou art in this <hi>ſtumber,</hi> thy <hi>Lamp</hi> will go out, like the <hi>fooliſh Virgins,</hi> Matth. xxv. 8. and thou wilt have nothing to meet Chriſt with when ever he comes.</p>
            <p>Thus have I ſhewed you <hi>negatively</hi> what will not make you <hi>ready</hi> for Chriſt, tho too many flatter and befool them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that it will, and will not ſuffer themſelves to be convinc'd of their <hi>error</hi> till it be too late to redeem and mend it. I earneſtly exhort you, and moſt heartily beg of God you may never be found in that number.</p>
            <p>And now I proceed to the poſitive part, to ſhew wherein <hi>Readineſs</hi> for Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, And</p>
            <p>Firſt, To be ready for Chriſt is to be a Good man, a Righteous man, an Holy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Godly Man. One who deſires to do
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:107489:23"/> the whole will of God ſincerely: both by ceaſing to do evil, and learning to do good, denying and abſtaining from all known ſin, and applying himſelf to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all known Duties: with a <hi>Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence void of offence both towards God and towards men.</hi> To be heartily Religious, Juſt and Sober, <hi>Crucifying the Fleſh with its affections and luſts.</hi> Walking before God with reſpect to all his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in a word, to be Chriſts true and faithful ſervant.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Scripture</hi> is expreſs and plain, that <hi>God will do good to them that are good and upright in their hearts.</hi> Pſal. cxxv. 4. That he will give eternal life, <hi>to them who by patient continuance in well doing ſeek for Glory and Immortality.</hi> Rom. ii. 7. and Chriſt himſelf hath told us that <hi>Not every one that ſaith unto me Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven: but he that doth the will of my Father which is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> Matth. vii. 21. and St. <hi>Paul. If ye live after the fleſh ye ſhall dye: but if ye by the Spirit mortifie the deeds of the body ye ſhall live,</hi> Rom. viii. 13. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. <hi>Be not deceived God is not mocked for whatſoever a man ſoweth, that ſhall he alſo reap.</hi> For <hi>he that ſoweth to his fleſh, ſhall of the fleſh reap corruption: but
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:107489:23"/> he that ſoweth to the ſpirit, ſhall of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit reap life eve laſting.</hi> Gal. vi. 7, 8. And the terms upon which St. <hi>Peter</hi> aſſures you of entrance into the <hi>Everlaſting King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> are that ye <hi>abound in Faith, Vertue, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, Temperance, Patience, Godlineſs, Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly kindneſs, Charity.</hi> 2 Pet. i. And <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Pſalm</hi> xv. gives the deſcription of a <hi>Citizen</hi> of <hi>Sion:</hi> who ſhall dwell in <hi>Gods Holy Hill,</hi> by the ſame meaſures. And in Gods name ſaith <hi>Pſalm</hi> l. 23. <hi>To him that ordereth his Converſation aright, will I ſhew the ſalvation of God.</hi> And laſtly 'tis Chriſts promiſe. <hi>Where I am there ſhall alſo my ſervants be,</hi> John xii. 26. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is the Scope and import of the whole Scripture both Old Teſtament and New, to ſhew that wicked and bad men ſhall go to <hi>Hell,</hi> and only Righteous and good men ſhall go to <hi>Heaven.</hi> Pſalm iv. 3. <hi>Know that God hath ſet apart him that is Godly for himſelf.</hi> But Pſalm ix. 17. <hi>The wicked ſhall be turned into Hell.</hi> Ezech. xviii. 20. <hi>The Righteouſneſs of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſhall be upon him and the wickedneſs of the wicked ſhall be upon him.</hi> John v. 29. <hi>They that have done good ſhall come forth to the Reſurrection of life, and they that have done evil to the Reſurrection of damnation.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:107489:24"/> For we muſt all appear at the Judgment Seat of Chriſt, that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to what he hath done whether it be good or bad,</hi> 2 Cor. v. 10.</p>
            <p>And I beſeech you, neither to cenſure, nor miſinterpret, this method of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding; by beginning to declare in ſuch general terms, wherein <hi>Readineſs</hi> for Chriſt conſiſts. But conſider the <hi>wiſdom</hi> of God leads me in it; for tho the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures</hi> do treat of theſe things ſome times more accurately and diſtinctly, yet for the moſt part they ſpeak of them in theſe general expreſſions. And that for Wiſe and Holy Reaſons. For the Scriptures were written not only for the Wiſe and Learned, but for the unwiſe and Ignorant, for Babes in Chriſt and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginners, as well as for grown men and Proficients. For the <hi>Lamb</hi> to waid in, as well as for the <hi>Elephant</hi> to ſwim in. Now for the ſake of the firſt ſort, who are not able to diſcern critical differences of things: nor to comprehend the more myſterious and intricate expreſſions, nor to underſtand <hi>Artificial</hi> and <hi>Figurative</hi> words: in which ſome times the <hi>Truths</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> are wrapt up and veiled: It ſeems very agreeable to the goodneſs
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:107489:24"/> of God to condeſcend to the weakneſs and capacities of thoſe, to whom he ſpeaks.</p>
            <p>And to propound the way of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> to <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Hell,</hi> in ſuch ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and eaſie terms, as all may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand. And ſuch as are ſuited to affect a Natural Conſcience: and to be an initial and leading way to the receiving, what the Goſpel ſpeaks more diſtincly and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately to thoſe, who are awakened to be inquiſitive, and rendered capable of what is more high and difficult, by the uſe of general words, and eaſie to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood: Such as theſe are, with which I have begun: To be <hi>ready</hi> for Chriſt, is to be a <hi>good</hi> man: for none but ſuch ſhall go to <hi>Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, To be <hi>ready</hi> for Chriſt is to be a good Chriſtian. And what that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies we ſhall beſt underſtand by our <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmal Covenant</hi> in which we enter upon the profeſſion of <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> Now as in that God promiſeth to accept us as <hi>Members</hi> of his Son, to own us for his <hi>Children</hi> and make us Inheritors of the Kingdom of Heaven: ſo we on our parts engage and promiſe three things, firſt to renounce the <hi>World</hi> the <hi>Fleſh</hi> and the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</hi> Secondly to believe all the <hi>Articles</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:107489:25"/> of the Chriſtian Religion, <hi>viz.</hi> with an Applicatory Faith. Thirdly, to keep Gods Holy Will and Commandments, and walk in the ſame all the days of our life, and he that keeps this Covenant is a good Chriſtian; and as a Child of God ſhall inherit his Kingdom: and is <hi>ready</hi> to go to it when ever Chriſt comes.</p>
            <p>Now theſe three, anſwer the three great <hi>Graces,</hi> which are the condition of the <hi>New Covenant.</hi> Repentance, Faith, and new Obedience. And tho the laſt is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in, and be reduceable to the firſt: becauſe no man truely repents of paſt <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience:</hi> who reſolves not, and who endeavours not, to yield unreſerved <hi>obedience</hi> for the future; and therefore the two former are oft put alone for the full and whole condition of the Goſpel Covenant. <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand, repent and believe the Goſpel.</hi> Yet I hope we may inoffenſively reckon them all three diſtinctly: eſpecially conſidering that tho they all have a general reſpect to the whole <hi>Holy Trinity,</hi> yet they may not improperly be ſaid to have a peculiar reference to the diſtinct Perſons, to whoſe name we are expreſly Conſecrated in our <hi>Baptiſm.</hi> The <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt, Repentance towards God,</hi> that is the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:107489:25"/> Father, <hi>Faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> So St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſly ſpeaks, <hi>Acts</hi> xx. 21. <hi>New Obedience</hi> towards the Holy Ghoſt, who is the immediate Author of <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> and to walk in newneſs of life is <hi>to walk in the ſpirit,</hi> Gal. v. 25. And <hi>to be led by the ſpirit,</hi> Rom. viii. 14.</p>
            <p>If therefore thou wouldeſt be a good Chriſtian, and as ſuch <hi>ready</hi> for Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Firſt, With Holy ſhame and Godly ſorrow turn from ſin and creatures, in which thou haſt too long ſought ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to God as thy all-ſufficient portion and happineſs.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Come to him by Chriſt the great and only <hi>Mediator,</hi> who hath made our peace with him, and wrought that reconciliation by which alone thou art capable of injoying him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, yield up thy ſelf to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the Holy Ghoſt, as thy <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier,</hi> to inable thee both to believe, and to bring forth the Fruits of Faith, in new obedience, as teſtimonies of thy ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere thankfulneſs: love being beſt ſeen in keeping the Commandments.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, to be <hi>ready</hi> for Chriſt, you muſt, 1. be Juſtified. 2. Sanctified. 3. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert and exerciſe that Faith, by which thy perſon is Juſtified, and thy Nature ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:107489:26"/> in watching for, and preparing againſt Chriſt coming. The two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer may be called our Habitual <hi>readineſs,</hi> ſuch as the <hi>Wiſe Virgins</hi> had, even whilſt they <hi>ſlumbered</hi> and <hi>ſlept.</hi> The third our actuals <hi>Readineſs,</hi> ſuch as theirs was when they awaked, and <hi>trimmed</hi> their <hi>Lamps.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The two firſt put us into a ſafe Eſtate of <hi>Readineſs</hi> for Chriſt coming, the third into a comfortable preſent diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to meet him at his coming.</p>
            <p>The firſt gives us a Title to Heaven. The ſecond a fit qualification for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the third an immediate and proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate diſpoſition for Heaven, and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent hope of our admittance into it.</p>
            <p>The two former concern our dying without danger, the third our dying without fear of danger, willingly, joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, triumphantly. Singing with old Simeon <hi>nunc dimittis. Lord now letteſt thou thy ſervant depart in peace.</hi> And St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Cupio diſſolvi, <hi>I deſire to be diſſolved and to be with Chriſt.</hi> And St. <hi>Johns</hi> veni do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine Jeſu, <hi>Even ſo come Lord Jeſus come quickly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A word of every of them; Firſt to be <hi>ready</hi> for Chriſt, thou muſt be <hi>Juſtified</hi> to give thee Right and Title to Heaven. For
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:107489:26"/> 
               <hi>we are all by Nature Children of wrath, Eph.</hi> ii. 3. And can claim no Inheritance but Hell, as our due. And we are hold under an unalterable Covenant, <hi>Do this and live,</hi> Rom x. 5. Which exacts and will abate nothing of perfect perſonal Obedience; which God knows, and our ſelves muſt acknowledg we are far from having performed, or any ability to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form: and an inexorable Law which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth <hi>a curſe againſt all that continue not in all that is written,</hi> Gal. iii. 10. And an inflexible Juſtice, which can neither be bribed nor forc'd. Not bribed becauſe 'tis Juſtice: not forc'd becauſe 'tis Gods. And all theſe keep the paſſage to Heaven more ſtrictly, than the <hi>Cherubim</hi> with the <hi>Flaming Sword</hi> did that of the <hi>Tree of Life:</hi> and there's no hope or poſſibility of getting in till theſe be ſatisfied, which in and of our ſelves we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver do.</p>
            <p>'Tis an eternal and immutable Truth, who ever is once a <hi>ſinner,</hi> can never come to Heaven till his ſin be <hi>pardoned</hi> and done away: and his perſon Juſtified in the ſight of God.</p>
            <p>If there were no other Texts in all the <hi>Bible,</hi> (tho there are abundance more of like import) that muſt be erazed and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:107489:27"/> cancelled, before an unpardoned ſinner, as ſuch, can have any hope. <hi>Rom.</hi> iii. 23. <hi>For all have ſinned and come ſhort of the glory of God: Being juſtified freely by his Grace through the redemption that is in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt: Whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitiation through Faith in his Blood, to declare his righteouſneſs for the remiſſion of ſins,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now whether Juſtification be wholly comprehended in forgiveneſs of ſin, as many great <hi>Divines</hi> do hold: or beſides Pardon, it include ſomewhat which muſt render us <hi>Righteous</hi> in the ſight of God: As neither fewer for number, nor leſs for name and note have taught, I liſt not to Diſpute: <hi>Polemical Divinity</hi> fits not the Pulpit: and is never leſs ſeaſonable than at a <hi>Funeral.</hi> Duſt caſt on fighting Bees ſoon ends the fray.</p>
            <p>This duſt of <hi>Death</hi> ſprinkled amongſt us ſhould mind us of our <hi>Work</hi> or <hi>Hives.</hi> And wherein ſoever the ſtrict notion of <hi>Juſtification</hi> doth conſiſt, this I may ſay is without Controverſie, that we muſt be <hi>pardoned</hi> and accepted as <hi>Righteous</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can ſtand in Gods ſight: and both theſe we muſt have by Faith in Chriſt. His Blood and Obedience purchaſe both, and our Faith muſt receive them
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:107489:27"/> and apply them that we may be <hi>Juſtified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt Pardon. Eph. i. 7. <hi>In whom we have redemption through his Blood, even the forgiveneſs of ſins. Be it known unto you therefore men and brethren, that through this man is preached to you the forgiveneſs of ſins. And by him all that believe are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified from all things, from which ye could not be juſtified by the Law of</hi> Moſes, Acts xiii. 38, 39. And 1 <hi>John</hi> i. 7. <hi>The Blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Son cleanſeth us from all ſin, and if any man ſin we have an Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: and he is the Propitiation for our ſins:</hi> Chap. ii. 1, 2. And in the Inſtitution of his <hi>Holy Supper</hi> he gives this Reaſon for the <hi>drinking</hi> of the <hi>Cup. Matth.</hi> xxvi. 27, 28. <hi>Drink ye all of it. For this is my blood of the New Teſtament which is ſhed for many for the remiſſion of ſins.</hi> And in <hi>Gal.</hi> iii. from the 5. to the 15. too long to be tranſcribed. <hi>God's Juſtifying the Heathen by Faith,</hi> and the <hi>Juſt's living by Faith,</hi> are argued from Chriſts being made a Curſe for us.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Righteouſneſs: <hi>He is the Lord our Righteouſneſs,</hi> Jer. xxiii. 6. <hi>He was made ſin for us;</hi> 1. A ſin offering, <hi>That we might be made the Righteouſneſs of God in him,</hi> 2 Cor. v. 21. <hi>As by the offence of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:107489:28"/> one, judgment came upon all to condemnation: even ſo by the Righteouſneſs of one, the free gift came upon all men, to Juſtification of life. For as by one mans diſobedience many were made ſinners: ſo by the obedience of one ſhall many be made Righteous,</hi> Rom. v. 18, 19. Read the whole <hi>Chapter,</hi> not to ſay the whole <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> the chief Scope of which tends this way. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> i. 30 <hi>Chriſt is made unto us of God Righteouſneſs,</hi> which made St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſo earneſtly deſire <hi>to be found in him, not having his own Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which is of the Law, but that which is through the Faith of Chriſt. The Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs which is of God by Faith,</hi> Phil. iii. 9.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We muſt be <hi>Sanctified</hi> by his Spirit, as well as Juſtified by his Merit. This muſt qualifie and make us fit for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. <hi>The pure in heart ſhall ſee God.</hi> Mat. v. 8. And <hi>without Holineſs none can ſee the Lord,</hi> Heb. xii. 14. For into the <hi>New Jeruſalem, ſhall in no wiſe enter, any thing that defileth, neither what ſoever worketh abomination or maketh a lye.</hi> Rev. xxi. 27.</p>
            <p>Without being Sanctified no man is fit, 1. For the Place. 2. For the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. 3. For the Work of Heaven.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Not for the place. 'Tis his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Heaven, Pſalm</hi> xx. 6. All the Types
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:107489:28"/> of it were Holy, <hi>Paradice,</hi> the <hi>Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle,</hi> the <hi>Temple,</hi> yea the Hill on which it ſtood: even a temporary and tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent manifeſtation of Gods Preſence or Glory Conſecrates the place: how much more Holy then is that place which is the <hi>Habitation of Gods Holineſs and Glory</hi> as Heaven is called, <hi>Iſay</hi> lxiii. 15. That part of the <hi>Temple</hi> where the <hi>Ark</hi> ſtood under the Wings of the <hi>Cherubims,</hi> the type of Gods conſtant reſidence (for the <hi>Mercy Seat</hi> was his Throne, and he dwelt betwixt the <hi>Cherubims</hi>) was called the <hi>moſt Holy,</hi> the <hi>Holy of Holies;</hi> the Holieſt of all: how Superlatively Holy then muſt that place be, of which this was but a figure.</p>
            <p>What ever God Sanctifies by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence muſt not be defiled by the approach or touch of any unclean thing. When God appears to <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Buſh or <hi>Joſhuah</hi> in the Vale, both muſt <hi>put off their ſhooes from their feet, becauſe the ground was holy on which they ſtood.</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice could bear our firſt Parents no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, when they had ſinned away their Innocence. Nay the <hi>Angels</hi> fell from Heaven, when they fell from the Holineſs in which they were created.</p>
            <p>And Poſſeſſion, (which you call Eleven Points) could not ſecure their ſtay. And
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:107489:29"/> thinkeſt thou with an unſanctified heart, which bears <hi>Satans</hi> Image to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into that place, from which that very <hi>Image</hi> caſt them out. 'Tis ſaid ſome Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels are ſo delicate and pure that they will hold no <hi>Poyſon,</hi> but cruſh and break in pieces to be rid on't. Should one ſinner get into Heaven with his unchanged, his invenomed Nature, Heaven would cleave under him as the Earth did under <hi>Korah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> rather than not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge it ſelf of him. Yea when he ſaw his own loathſomneſs in that pure place, he would ſave and prevent their labour who would caſt him out, and partly for ſhame to be ſo unlike the reſt, and partly for the unagreeableneſs of the place to his expectations and deſires, he would leap down headlong, rather than tarry there. As <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah</hi> when the <hi>Leproſie</hi> aroſe in his Forehead, the <hi>Prieſts</hi> thruſt him out of the <hi>Temple,</hi> yea he himſelf haſted to go out, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> xxvi. 20. And the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is remarkable concerning the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> which kept not their firſt State, they left their own Habitation, <hi>Jud. verſe</hi> 6. for though <hi>Michael</hi> and his <hi>Angels</hi> fought and caſt them out, <hi>Rev.</hi> xii. 7, 8, 9. Yet they were ſoon weary of Heaven, and of their Holy Habitation, and ready
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:107489:29"/> enough to leave it of their own accord, when they had made themſelves ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to it.</p>
            <p>And what ever they think, who look upon <hi>Heaven</hi> as a reſerve, when they can ſtay no longer in this world, to be choſen rather than the place of Torment: and phanſie it like a <hi>Tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>kiſh Paradice,</hi> a place of eaſe and ſloath, to eat and drink, and gratifie their ſenſualities, from an abſurd miſunderſtanding of ſome alluſive and <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurative</hi> expreſſions; yet if an unſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied man, with his heart full of his preſent <hi>Antipathies</hi> againſt the Holineſs of that place, ſhould ſtep in thither, it would certainly be the moſt irkſom and diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable place he ever came in, and more like a <hi>Purgatory</hi> than a <hi>Paradice,</hi> and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was he ſo uneaſie, as he would be there, nor was ever creature ſo much out of its <hi>Element,</hi> as ſuch a man would be. And how ſtrange or ſurprizing ſoever this may ſeem, its eaſie to convince you of its Truth by Principles of <hi>Reaſon.</hi> For likeneſs is the cauſe of liking, and <hi>Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi> ariſeth from the ſutableneſs of the <hi>Object</hi> to the <hi>Subject</hi> that receives it.

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:107489:30"/> they are ſuited: which are not ſo at all to others. <hi>Hony</hi> is very ſweet to an Healthful Pallate: but bitter to the Tongue which is dryed and ſcortched with a <hi>Feaver.</hi> Meat and drink are very pleaſant to an hungry Stomach, but their ſight or ſmell will make him <hi>Sick</hi> who is troubled with a <hi>nauſea</hi> or loathing: <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick</hi> and <hi>Songs</hi> greatly delight a chearful airy ſpirit, but to him that is of an <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy</hi> heart, are like the taking away a <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in cold weather, <hi>Prov.</hi> xxv. 20. And to him that's tyr'd out for want of reſt, one hours <hi>Sleep</hi> would be more welcome, than the beſt <hi>Melody</hi> of Voice or Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>We are never well but when we are where we would be: and we would never be out of our own <hi>Element.</hi> The <hi>Worm</hi> in the Earth, the <hi>Bird</hi> in the Air, the <hi>Fiſh</hi> in the water, not only live, but each in his <hi>Place</hi> doth grow, and ſing and play.

            <p>Sin and this World are a ſinners <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and put him into <hi>Heaven</hi> whilſt he continues ſuch, and his Heart would dye within him as ſoon as he found where he was. The <hi>Air</hi> of that purer <hi>Region,</hi> that Holy <hi>Climate</hi> would be to him as <hi>Ireland</hi> is
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:107489:30"/> ſaid to be to <hi>Spiders, Toads</hi> and <hi>Vipers.</hi> His <hi>Converſation</hi> muſt be in <hi>Heaven,</hi> whilſt he lives, <hi>Phil.</hi> iii. 20. to whom <hi>Heaven</hi> would be <hi>Heaven</hi> indeed, that is, a place of <hi>Bliſs</hi> and ſatisfaction when he <hi>dyes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, The <hi>Company:</hi> And this makes an unſanctified perſon more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for Heaven, and would render his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there yet more uneaſie to him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Can two walk together except they be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed? Amos</hi> iii. 3. And there is juſt ſuch <hi>agreement</hi> betwixt a wicked unſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ſinner, and all the <hi>Company</hi> in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: as there is betwixt <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Belial,</hi> the <hi>Seed</hi> of the <hi>Woman</hi> and the <hi>Seed</hi> of the <hi>Serpent.</hi> You may find what <hi>Company</hi> there is in Heaven by that ſhort, yet full Muſter-Rowl of that Heavenly <hi>Hoſt, Heb.</hi> xii. 22, 23, 24. The ſum of which is this, that in the <hi>City</hi> of the living God the Heavenly <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> there are <hi>God the Judg of all, Jeſus the Mediator of the New Covenant, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable company of Holy Angels, the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Aſſembly and Church of the firſt born, which are written in Heaven, and the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of juſt men made perfect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if amongſt all theſe, a more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſearch be made then, was amongſt all the creatures for an help for <hi>Adam,</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:107489:31"/> The return muſt be made us then, <hi>non eſt inventus.</hi> There was not found for <hi>Adam</hi> a meet help, <hi>Gen.</hi> ii. 20. So amongſt all theſe will not be found a <hi>meet Companion</hi> for an <hi>unſanctified ſinner.</hi> Not <hi>God:</hi> for he hath been uſed to ſay to him, <hi>Depart from me, I deſire not the knowledg of thy ways. What is the Almighty that I ſhould ſerve him? Job</hi> xxi. 20. And God will take him at his word, they'l never come together, nor will he now be ſerved or injoyed by him.</p>
            <p>Not <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for of him he ſaid, <hi>this man ſhall not reign over me,</hi> Luke xix. 14. What therefore ſhould he do in his <hi>Kingdom?</hi> Or how can he have <hi>Fellowſhip</hi> with him, who trampled his <hi>blood</hi> under his <hi>Feet?</hi> Not the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> whom he always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, grieved, vexed, fretted, and did deſpight unto; whilſt he was ſtriving with him, to render him a meet <hi>Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> for God.</p>
            <p>Not the <hi>Holy Angels,</hi> for he never cauſed their <hi>Joy</hi> in <hi>Heaven</hi> by his Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: and they can not be glad to ſee him there. Not the <hi>Spirits of juſt men made perfect:</hi> for the beginnings of that perfection in the firſt lineaments of Chriſts <hi>Image</hi> on their hearts and lives: and the initial participation of the <hi>Divine
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:107489:31"/> Nature</hi> made them the <hi>Objects</hi> of his ſcorn and hatred. Whom tho his Brethren by Nature, he loved juſt as <hi>Cain</hi> did <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel:</hi> and for the ſame reaſon, 1 <hi>John</hi> iii. 12. Or as <hi>Iſhmael</hi> did <hi>Iſaac,</hi> or <hi>Eſaw Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> or as a <hi>Wolfe</hi> doth love a <hi>Sheep. The Righteous is abomination to the Wicked, Prov.</hi> xxix. 27. And what a kind of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> would it be for an unſanctified man to be ſhut up with ſuch <hi>Company</hi> as he hates with the worſt of <hi>Antipathies:</hi> and <hi>vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies</hi> with the bittereſt cenſures, and moſt deſpightful ſcorn?</p>
            <p>Nor could the <hi>Company</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> like him better than he likes them. <hi>For God is not a God that hath pleaſure in wickedneſs, nor ſhall evil dwell with him, Pſal.</hi> v. 4, 5. Chriſt ſaith to them <hi>depart from me, ye that work iniquity, Matth.</hi> vii. 23. The Holy Spirit will not entertain him, who would never open the door to him, knockt he never ſo earneſtly and long, but all ways ſhut him out of his heart. 'Tis the Offices of the bleſſed <hi>Angels</hi> to <hi>gather out of the Kingdom all things that offend, and them that do iniquity: and to caſt them into a furnace of fire, Matth.</hi> xiii. 41, 42. And they will do their Office impartially. As for the <hi>Saints,</hi> as they could give them no <hi>Oyl</hi> to help them in <hi>Matth.</hi> xxv. 9. So
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:107489:32"/> would they give them no countenance, ſhould they get in without it. <hi>Moſes</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes them, <hi>John</hi> v. 45. The ſouls under the <hi>Altar</hi> cryed againſt them whilſt they lived, <hi>Revel.</hi> vi. 9. And ſhall judg them when they dye, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> vi. 2. The whole Herd makes head againſt a blown <hi>Deer.</hi> Thoſe Loyal <hi>Subjects</hi> will not harbour ſuch Traitors againſt their Lord and King. Then ſhall be the great <hi>Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication:</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> of the firſt born will put from amongſt them every wicked perſon, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 13. injoyns. Therefore Oh unſanctified ſinner bethink thy ſelf in time. <hi>To which of the Saints wilt thou turn,</hi> Job v. 1.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Work</hi> of Heaven: which he hath neither skill to perform, nor time nor heart to learn, renders an <hi>unſanctified</hi> man as uncapable of <hi>Heaven</hi> as either of the former. For the <hi>Work</hi> of Heaven is to ſerve the Lord inceſſantly. <hi>And his ſervants ſhall ſerve him,</hi> Rev. xxii. 3. To do his Will ſo perfectly, that 'tis fet as a pattern how to do it on Earth: <hi>Thy will be done on Earth as 'tis in Heaven,</hi> Mat. vi. To love the Lord with perpetual <hi>extaſtes,</hi> and raviſhments of Soul: to <hi>Worſhip</hi> him that ſits upon the Throne, and give him glory, throwing down their Crowns at
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:107489:32"/> his feet, and ſaying <hi>thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour, and power,</hi> to ſound forth Eternal <hi>Hallelujahs,</hi> and not <hi>to ceaſe either day or night, from crying Holy, Holy, Holy: to him which was, and is, and is to come,</hi> Rev. iv. <hi>To ſing the Song of</hi> Moſes, <hi>and the Lamb who redeemed them from the Earth, and made them to his Father, Kings and Prieſts to offer up the pure</hi> incenſe of Eternal Praiſes. And ſuch as this being the inceſſant endleſs imployment of <hi>Heaven,</hi> I beſeech you give me leave with freedom, to Appeal to your Conſciences, who either never Pray nor Praiſe: or ſlubber over a few formal <hi>Devotions,</hi> for cuſtom ſake, and to ſtop the Mouth of <hi>Conſcience</hi> with the greateſt wearineſs, as the moſt irkſome task and druggery of your lives, and are ſo tyr'd at a Prayer or Sermon, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing tries your patience like it: or ſeems ſo tedious, and ſo much the more as the ſervice is more ſpiritual and ſearching: what would you do in Heaven? what corner would you find to ſleep in? How many wearyed and longing Eyes would you caſt upon that Glaſs of Eternity, which will never be run out: How tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous would that everlaſting <hi>Sabbath</hi> ſeem, when you ſo often ask of theſe below,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:107489:33"/> 
               <hi>when will they be gone.</hi> Amos viii. 5. I intreat you therefore be convinced of the indiſpenſible neceſſity of <hi>Sanctification</hi> to make you fit to go to Heaven with Chriſt. For either God muſt change the Nature of Heaven, to fit it to thy <hi>Phanſie,</hi> which he will never do: or thy heart muſt be made like it, even Holy and Heavenly to ſavour and delight in the things of God, or elſe Heaven it ſelf would be no Heaven to thee.</p>
            <p>In a word: without <hi>Juſtification</hi> thou canſt not go to Heaven as a ſtate of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs tho thou wouldſt: and without <hi>Sanctification</hi> thou wouldſt not go to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as a ſtate of Holineſs tho thou mightſt. See <hi>Col.</hi> i. 12. <hi>Giving thanks to the Father who hath made us meet to be partakers of the Inheritance of the Saints in light.</hi> Mark! 'Tis an Inheritance: thou muſt be made a Son to have a Title to Inherit: there's Juſtification. But 'tis an <hi>inheritance of the Saints in light,</hi> and thou muſt be made a <hi>Saint</hi> and Child of Light, to be meet to enter into the poſſeſſion of it. There's Sanctification, 1 Cor vi. 9, 10, 11. <hi>Know ye not that the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God? be not deceived nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fernicators nor Idolaters,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Kingdom of God, and ſuch were
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:107489:33"/> ſome of you,</hi> how then came they to be capable? <hi>But ye are waſhed, but ye are ſanctified, but ye are juſtified in the name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the ſpirit of our God.</hi> Here you have them both expreſly. St. <hi>Paul</hi> again tells you, <hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 30. <hi>Whom he juſtified, them he alſo glorified.</hi> In which place alſo we have both theſe, the firſt explicitely: you muſt be <hi>juſtified</hi> before you can be <hi>glorified,</hi> the ſecond im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely, for therefore glorified ſignifies perfectly ſanctified. Grace is glory in the Bud and Bloſom. Glory is Grace in the full blown Flower and ripe Fruit: Now as no ripe Fruit without a Bloſom, no full blown Roſe without a Bud; ſo no Glory without Grace preceeding. <hi>From glory to glory.</hi> 1 Cor. iii. <hi>ult.</hi> That is from Glory inchoate in Grace on Earth, to Glory conſummate in Bliſs in Heaven. As child-hood is before man-hood, and he that never was a child, ſhall never be a man: So he in whoſe heart Chriſt was never formed by the immortal ſeed. Who never was born of the Spirit. Who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver as a <hi>new born Babe deſired the ſincere Milk of the Word to grow thereby,</hi> ſhall never arrive at the <hi>Stature</hi> of the fulneſs of Chriſt, ſhall never attain to that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Image</hi> of the Son of God, to which
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:107489:34"/> all his, are <hi>Predeſtinated</hi> to be Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable: ſhall never be a perfect man in Chriſt, nor appear before him perfect in <hi>Zion,</hi> to follow the <hi>Lamb</hi> upon that Holy Mountain.</p>
            <p>The Conceptions which the beſt men have of Heaven, are very low, obſcure and imperfect, but certainly thoſe which ignorant and prophane men have of it, are ſtrangely abſurd and brutiſh, or it were impoſſible they ſhould ever hope to get thither, till their ſins be both pardoned and ſubdued; for 'tis next to a <hi>contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> to think they can <hi>reign</hi> with Chriſt, in whoſe mortal <hi>Bodies,</hi> or immortal <hi>Souls</hi> ſin is allowed, and continues to <hi>reign.</hi> For, leaſt of all in this ſence, can <hi>corruption inherit incorruption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Tho the two things, we laſt inſiſted on, are the main to <hi>conſtitute</hi> us Chriſtians, and bleſſed is he that hath attained them; to be <hi>Juſtified</hi> and <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified:</hi> yet one thing is farther neceſſary, if not to the <hi>Eſſe,</hi> the <hi>Being,</hi> yet to the <hi>bene Eſſe</hi> the <hi>well Being</hi> of a Chriſtian, to render us compleatly and actually <hi>ready,</hi> for Chriſts preſent coming:</p>
            <p>They that had their <hi>Lamps</hi> lighted, and Oyl provided in their Veſſels, yet <hi>ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered</hi> and ſlept: and tho their <hi>Lamps</hi> were
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:107489:34"/> not gone out, they burnt <hi>dim,</hi> and wanted new <hi>trimming.</hi> The brighteſt <hi>Coals</hi> will vail themſelves with <hi>Aſhes,</hi> if they be not blown off. And the cleareſt waters will contract a ſlime and muddy Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by long ſtanding; and ſo will our <hi>Graces,</hi> decline, wax <hi>Faint,</hi> and <hi>languiſh:</hi> if they be not exerted, ſtirred up, and exerciſed: which makes it moſt needful, to be daily acting that Faith a freſh upon the promiſes, by which we are <hi>juſtified,</hi> and actuating that Grace anew, by which we are <hi>Sanctified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are many expreſſions in <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi> whereby this duty is injoyned, as <hi>trimming our Lamps,</hi> Matth. xxv. 7. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>our loins girded, and our lights bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> Luke xii. 35. <hi>ſtirring up the gift of God,</hi> 2 Tim. i. 6. which in the <hi>Greek</hi> is an eligant Metaphor, ſignifying the blowing off the Aſhes. <hi>Giving all diligence to make our calling and election ſure,</hi> 2 Pet. i. 10. <hi>Proving our own ſelves,</hi> 2 Cor. xiii. 5. <hi>Growing in Grace,</hi> 2 Pet. iii. 18. <hi>Going on to perfection. Reaching forth to thoſe things which are before: preſſing towards the mark for the price,</hi> Phil. iii. 14. Being <hi>Righteous</hi> ſtill, and <hi>Holy</hi> ſtill, Rev. xxii. 11. that is, let him take care to be more and more ſo, by holding faſt what we have,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:107489:35"/> 
               <hi>Rev.</hi> iii. 3, 11. By <hi>keeping</hi> our ſelves in the <hi>Love of God, Jud.</hi> 21. <hi>Looking</hi> for and <hi>haſtning</hi> to the <hi>coming</hi> of the <hi>day of God,</hi> 2 Pet. iii. 12. With many more, but the moſt frequent and moſt ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant is <hi>Watching. Watch therefore for ye know neither the day nor the hour when your Lord doth come,</hi> Mat. xxiv. 42. xxv. 13. Mark xiii. 35. <hi>and</hi> 37. <hi>What I ſay unto you I ſay unto all Watch. Watch ye, ſtand faſt in the Faith, quit you like men, be ſtrong,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xvi. 13.</p>
            <p>Now this charge given us in the <hi>Text,</hi> to be <hi>ready,</hi> as it, in the firſt place, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires our ſpeedy care to get our ſins par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, and our peace made with God, and our hearts changed, and our Natures renued to the Image of God, ſo it far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther puts us upon a dayly ſtrengthning our <hi>Faith,</hi> and renuing our <hi>Repentance,</hi> labouring after aſſurance, ſtanding upon our conſtant guard, and endeavouring to be always in ſuch a <hi>poſture,</hi> as we would be willing, nay glad, to be found in, when ever Chriſt ſhall come. To <hi>Watch</hi> againſt ſloath, ſecurity, worldly cares, relap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes into ſin, or what ever may overcharge our hearts, and render us liable to <hi>ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, or to be overtaken with that day at unawares,</hi> read <hi>Luke</hi> xxi. 34, 35, 36. To riſe ſpeedily from our falls into ſin, by
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:107489:35"/> preſent <hi>Repentance.</hi> To be <hi>watchful</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all <hi>temptations</hi> to ſin, and occaſions of backſliding or declining.</p>
            <p>For admitting, that on Gods part, <hi>(whoſe gifts and calling are without Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> Rom. xi. 29. and who loves <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably, and to the end, them whom he takes for his own,</hi> Joh. xiii. 1.) Thoſe who are truly <hi>Juſtified</hi> and <hi>Sanctified,</hi> cannot fall totally and finally, from that eſtate: becauſe God upholds them with his hand: and <hi>none can take them out of his hand, becauſe he is ſtronger than all,</hi> Joh. x. 28. 29. and the <hi>Righteous</hi> are an <hi>everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Foundation,</hi> Prov. x. 25. becauſe the <hi>Foundation of God ſtandeth ſure, having this ſeal the Lord knoweth who are his,</hi> 2 Tim. ii. 19. and theſe two, <hi>Deus Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debit,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtus Oravit,</hi> Gods Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial care over them, and Chriſts conſtant interceſſion for them: will preſerve them to, and at the laſt. Yet were it as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble on Gods part, as 'tis on theirs: It would be very ſad for <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Bathſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bah,</hi> to have dyed like <hi>Zimri</hi> and <hi>Cosby,</hi> as they ſinned like them; and for St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> to have breathed out his ſoul, in that breath, which was polluted with <hi>denying</hi> and <hi>forſwearing</hi> of his Maſter; and for any man to <hi>dye</hi> without, at leaſt a General
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:107489:36"/> Repentance for every ſin; and Particular Repentance for every groſs and known ſin, and therefore we muſt be upon our conſtant <hi>Watch</hi> and <hi>Guard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Eſpecially conſidering this <hi>Watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> is appointed as a means to preſerve us from falling, (<hi>Watch and Pray leſt ye fall into temptation,</hi> Mark xiv. 38.) By him who deſigns the <hi>means,</hi> as well as the <hi>end.</hi> And hath no where ſecured the <hi>end</hi> to them, who <hi>diſobey</hi> and <hi>tempt</hi> him, by neglecting of the <hi>means,</hi> and for want of <hi>Watching.</hi> Admitting again they cannot break their <hi>Necks,</hi> (as the uſual compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon is) wholly loſe their <hi>Spiritual life:</hi> yet may they break their <hi>Legs</hi> and their <hi>Arms,</hi> and all their other <hi>Limbs,</hi> and go maimed and halting to their <hi>Graves.</hi> And may incur many dreadful evils to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, beſides the diſhonour they bring to God, reproach to the <hi>Goſpel</hi> and ſcandal and offence they give to others: for they may by grieving the Spirit provoke him to ſuſpend his influence: may wound their own Conſcience: weaken their Graces, loſe their Comforts: fall under deſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: pull down Temporal vengeance on themſelves: be brought into bondage by the <hi>fear of death:</hi> leſſen their reward in the Kingdom of Heaven, tho they ſhould not
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:107489:36"/> wholly be ſhut out: yea may make it juſtly queſtionable, to themſelves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: whether they were ever <hi>Juſtified</hi> and <hi>Sanctified</hi> indeed, or had any more than a name to live. All which do ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely out weigh the ſhort, the paultry, the filthy pleaſures of ſin that their ſloath, and neglect of Watching may gratifie them with: that I hope they may abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly convince you of the neceſſity of adding this laſt care, to what went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to be preſently <hi>ready</hi> for Chriſt: and to keep your ſelves ſo, by <hi>Watching</hi> and ſtanding always on your <hi>guard;</hi> till he ſhall come and give you the bleſſing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to thoſe he finds ſo <hi>doing,</hi> Matth. xxiv. 46.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now proceed to an uſeful im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of this weighty truth, that it is the indiſpenſable duty, and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt wiſdom of every man, to be preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>ready</hi> for Chriſts coming, and I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour it in four Uſes.</p>

            <p>I take it for granted, that ſome thing is, yea very much is, incumbent on us, to be done on our parts: and that wretched <hi>Opinion,</hi> that we may neglect duty to Gods <hi>Revealed will;</hi> upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of devolving all upon his <hi>Secret Decrees,</hi> is fitter to be exploded and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred amongſt Chriſtians, than confuted.

            <p>Firſt, Be throughly convinced of thy own <hi>unreadineſs:</hi> Sence of want is the firſt, the moſt Natural and moſt effectual mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, to ſeek ſupply. <hi>Jacob</hi> would never have ſent his Sons, much leſs his <hi>Benjamin,</hi> into <hi>Egypt</hi> to buy Food, if the <hi>Famine</hi> had not pincht him, and his Houſhold in the Land of <hi>Canaan. The full ſoul loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth an Hony Comb, but to the hungry ſoul even bitter things are ſweet.</hi> They who are <hi>whole care not for the Phyſitian, but the ſick</hi> will both ſend for him, and Fee him wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly. Chriſt calls thoſe who are <hi>weary</hi> and <hi>heavy laden</hi> with the <hi>burden</hi> of ſin, <hi>Curſe</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> ſence of Gods wrath, and 'tis well if theſe will come, there is moſt hope of them, but for others, he may <hi>ſtretch out his hand all the day long,</hi> and they regard it not. There was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough ſaid before to convince thee of thy <hi>unreadineſs,</hi> if thou beeſt an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſanctified</hi> man, this is only added to perſuade thee to conſider it, and to yield to conviction of thy ſin and miſery.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Be perſuaded of the infinite concernment of this matter: the <hi>water</hi> will riſe no higher than the <hi>Spring</hi> Head: and the motion will anſwer the weight which cauſeth it, a ſmall weight pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth but ſlow motion, but a great and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:107489:38"/> heavy one, ſuch as is quick and violent. They that have <hi>ſlight</hi> thoughts of the concerns of another <hi>world,</hi> 'tis no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der they are ſo little concerned about them: But they that conſider well what is the Conſequence of not being <hi>ready</hi> when <hi>Chriſt comes,</hi> what it is to have all the doors of Grace and Mercy, Hope and Glory ſhut againſt them, what it is to loſe an <hi>Immortal Soul,</hi> which the gain of an whole world could not compenſate. What it is to be driven from God and Chriſt, and the Regions of Bliſs, with a <hi>depart ye Curſed into everlaſting fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels:</hi> to be ſhut up in that Dungeon of utter dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>where ſhall be weeping and wailing and gnaſhing of teeth,</hi> under the gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the <hi>Worm,</hi> which ſhall never <hi>dye,</hi> and in midſt of a <hi>fire</hi> that ſhall never be <hi>quenched:</hi> in a word, they that wiſely lay to heart this Truth, that the injoyment or loſs of infinite and everlaſting <hi>happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> and the ſuffering or eſcaping end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and unconceivable <hi>torments,</hi> infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly depends upon being, or not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>ready</hi> for Chriſt, when he comes by Death or Judgment, will have other thoughts of theſe things, and will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened by them to make <hi>ready</hi> in good
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:107489:38"/> earneſt. Which I heartily wiſh we all may.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Get clear and diſtinct know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the main Grounds of Religion. Knowledg is a loading Grace, <hi>the new man is renewed in knowledg,</hi> Col. iii. 10. And without it the <hi>heart</hi> cannot be good, tho it be too often without a good heart. But of all <hi>Knowledg,</hi> get as full and clear a <hi>Knowledg</hi> as you can, of the Covenant of Grace: by which alone the enmity is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and reconciliation is made, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween an offended God, and loſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. And herein eſpecially ſtudy to know the <hi>Mediator</hi> of this <hi>Covenant,</hi> as to his Perſon, Natures and Offices, and the Efficacy of his Death, Reſurrection and Interceſſion: with the terms upon which he will receive thee as one of his redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ones: and what returns he expects from thee. What be thoſe <hi>ſure Mercies of David</hi> that Covenant conveighs, and what Obligations they are brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, who are received into it, the <hi>Knowledg</hi> of theſe things is ſo uſeful, ſo neceſſary, ſo excellent, comprehending the true knowledg of Salvation: 'tis hard to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt from farther inlarging upon it, or preſſing of it. An Intereſt in this <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> being the only means left us,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:107489:39"/> for our Eternal ſafety and welfare.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Frequently reflect upon thy <hi>Baptiſmal Covenant.</hi> I know no one thing in all the world, more hopefully likely to reſtore the life of ſollid Chriſtianity to the world, which is ſo miſerably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed and dead in it, than this would be.</p>
            <p>For, firſt, It would mightily <hi>reſtrain</hi> ſin, the bane of <hi>Chriſtianity:</hi> to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber how ſolemnly we have renounced all the temptations and inducements to it: and no leſs provoke us to Faith and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, the two great Pillars upon which <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> is built: to think what Vows of God are upon us, and make us ſay with <hi>David. I have ſworn, and I wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> perform it that I will keep all thy Righteous Judgments,</hi> Pſal. cxix. 106.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It would put warmth, and Holy fire, into all our <hi>Devotions,</hi> which are moſtly ſo formal cold and dead. To conſider what mutual engagements have paſt betwixt us, and that God to whom that <hi>Mediator</hi> through whom, and that bleſſed Spirit, by whoſe aſſiſtance we perform them. They being all, by true interpretation, farther inforcements o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> thoſe engagements, as were eaſie to ſhew in all the particulars of Prayer, Hearing
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:107489:39"/> the Word, and Receiving the Holy Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It would heal our Diviſions, and cloſe up our Breaches, and reſtore that bleſſed Spirit of Love and Peace. The <hi>Bond</hi> of Perfection and <hi>Badg</hi> of Chriſts Diſciples, and help us to keep and <hi>hold the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace,</hi> as you may ſee from the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> arguing, <hi>Eph.</hi> iv. 4, 5, 6. To call to mind, that we are all <hi>Baptiſed</hi> into one Body, joyned to one Head, received into the Family of one Father, obliged by the ſame Laws, made Candidates and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectants of the ſame <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> above, which is the Mother of us all.</p>
            <p>And what would have ſo <hi>beneficial</hi> an influence upon the life of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fail to <hi>prepare</hi> us for the <hi>coming of Chriſt.</hi> I therefore again inforce my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate requeſts to you: that you would often and dayly meditate upon your <hi>Baptiſmal</hi> Engagements to the great God.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Apply thy ſelf <hi>ſincerely</hi> and <hi>ſeriouſly,</hi> to the uſe of all Gods means: with an earneſt expectation and deſign, to receive from them, what God hath appointed them to conveigh to thoſe who uſe them aright. Men for the moſt part
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:107489:40"/> uſe them <hi>cuſtomarily,</hi> and for <hi>faſhion ſake,</hi> expecting little from them, and receive as little as they expect. They proving dry Breaſts and empty Channels. But if thou wouldeſt uſe them as thou ſhouldeſt, thou wouldeſt find it <hi>good to draw nigh to God,</hi> and that he never bid <hi>the houſe of</hi> Jacob <hi>ſeek his face in vain.</hi> 'Tis the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of means, to come in the middle, between what a man can do, and what he can not do, to help him by what he can do, to attain to what he can not do. In order to be <hi>ready</hi> for Chriſt, ſome thing a man can do, ſome thing he can not do. He can <hi>Read, Hear, Pray, Conſider,</hi> ſtir his Natural affections, <hi>Love, Fear, Hope, Deſire,</hi> by weighing what he knows. Some things, as yet, he can not do. <hi>Repent, turn to God, believe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly,</hi> for theſe are the <hi>gifts</hi> and <hi>work</hi> of God. Now God hath ſet the <hi>firſt</hi> in the way to the <hi>ſecond,</hi> as it were in the middle betwixt what he can do, and what he can not, that by doing what he can at preſent: he may gradually come to ability to do, what he cannot yet do, and by degrees may aſcend thither; whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he could not reach <hi>(per Sal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>um)</hi> at once: I will make this plain by an eaſie <hi>compariſon.</hi> A man cannot at one ſtride
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:107489:40"/> ſtep up into the Room above him, ten foot higher than the floor he ſtands on: but if there be a <hi>Pair of Stairs,</hi> he can ſet his Foot firſt on the loweſt, than on the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, third, and by degrees aſcend a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, third, fourth Story, tho ten or twenty Foot above the place from whence he firſt began. Juſt thus, there is a <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs Ladder</hi> of many Rounds, ſet up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth.</hi> We cannot ſtep at once from <hi>Nature</hi> to <hi>Grace,</hi> from <hi>Earth</hi> to <hi>Heaven;</hi> but we may begin at the foot of this <hi>Ladder,</hi> and climb from the firſt Round to the ſecond, and then the third, and ſo to the top, and gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by the help of this Ladder, and the hand of the Spirit leading us up, we come to that, which without this we could not reach by the <hi>means</hi> of Grace, we attain <hi>Grace:</hi> and by <hi>Grace,</hi> as a means we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Glory.</hi> I therefore again preſs you to <hi>Read, Hear, Pray, Meditate</hi> with honeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, and an humble expectation of Gods bleſſing upon his own Inſtitutions, and thy labour ſhall not be in vain in the Lord.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Allow your ſelves due time and leiſure for theſe things. Be good Husbands of time; no thrift is more commendable. Eternity depends upon it. And as I would ſpecially com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:107489:41"/> unto you the ſtrict <hi>Sanctifying</hi> the <hi>Lords day:</hi> a thing much out of uſe, which is one of the moſt viſible Cauſes, why the power of Godlineſs, withers and dwindles ſo much away. (For 'tis eaſily obſervable that <hi>Religion</hi> thrives and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers proportionably to the <hi>improvement</hi> of this day: and flouriſheth, or is tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den down, according as this Fence is kept up, or <hi>neglected.</hi>) So let me earneſtly commend to you, the ſetting apart ſome Portion of time every day, for God and your ſouls. That as God hath the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of a <hi>Day-Sabbath</hi> out of the Week: He may have as it were an <hi>Hour-Sabbath</hi> out of every Day. As there was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Morning and Evening <hi>Sacrifice</hi> day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under the Law: ſo there ſhould be at leaſt, Morning and Evening time allowed for Spiritual Sacrifice under the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>And here I cannot, I dare not, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to <hi>caution</hi> you of this <hi>great City;</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the over laviſh ſpending of whole Evenings in <hi>Publick Houſes,</hi> and at your <hi>Clubbs.</hi> (Tho 'tis eaſiy to foreſee it may offend, both thoſe, whoſe guilt, and whoſe intereſt it toucheth, for both theſe are teachy things) not that I am ſo <hi>rigid</hi> as to cenſure <hi>moderate Diverſion,</hi> and <hi>Friendly Converſation.</hi> But I fear, yea I
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:107489:41"/> greatly fear, there is a <hi>fault,</hi> yea a great fault in this matter. If after your <hi>Shops,</hi> your <hi>Counting-Houſe,</hi> and <hi>Buſineſs,</hi> and the <hi>Change</hi> have taken all the day, the <hi>Coffee-Houſe,</hi> the <hi>Tavern,</hi> and the <hi>Clubb,</hi> ſhall take up all your Evening. What's left for <hi>God,</hi> for <hi>Souls,</hi> and for <hi>Eternity?</hi> And thou returneſt home ſo late, that thy <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily</hi> is in Bed, or half aſleep, and thy head full of <hi>Stories</hi> and <hi>News,</hi> at leaſt, if not of ſomething worſe: How ſlenderly, curſorily, and uncompoſedly is God like to be ſerved, in <hi>Family</hi> and <hi>Cloſet,</hi> if not ſhut out of both? And what if Chriſt ſhould come and find you doing thus? Could you expect his <hi>Euge bone ſerve? well done good and faithful ſervant,</hi> or not rather his frown, with why haſt thou ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me thus?</p>
            <p>Seventhly, If thou wouldeſt be <hi>ready</hi> for Chriſt; get thy heart furniſh'd and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, as that Room was where he eat his <hi>laſt Paſſover,</hi> Mark xiv. 15. Caſt out all thy <hi>Luſts,</hi> and caſt off every <hi>weight;</hi> but above all keep thy ſelf from thine <hi>own iniquity,</hi> foſter no boſome ſin, enter into league with none. Tho 'twill be hard enough to get rid of others, yet thou'ld be eaſilier quit of twenty others than of ſuch an one.</p>
            <pb n="60" facs="tcp:107489:42"/>
            <p>A <hi>darling</hi> ſin, a <hi>boſom</hi> ſin, a <hi>peccatum in deliciis,</hi> is of all ſins moſt offenſive to God, moſt dangerous to our ſelves. One <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilah</hi> was too ſtrong for <hi>Sampſon</hi> himſelf: and he could not ſtand before her, before whom a thouſand men fell at one time: but ſhe coſt him his <hi>Eyes</hi> and his <hi>Life.</hi> Every ſin is a <hi>ſnare,</hi> and a <hi>cord</hi> to intangle men; but none ſo much as his <hi>Own</hi> ſin. His <hi>Own</hi> iniquities, (there's the Empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis) his <hi>Own</hi> ſhall take the wicked himſelf, and he ſhall be holden with the Cords of <hi>His</hi> ſins, <hi>Prov.</hi> v. 22. Whether it be the ſin of thy <hi>Natural Conſtitution,</hi> or thy <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> and <hi>Profeſſion</hi> of life: or the <hi>time</hi> and <hi>place</hi> thou liveſt in; or that long uſage and <hi>cuſtom</hi> hath indeared to thee. (For from theſe four quarters, this blaſting wind, uſually blows upon men) and made as a <hi>right Hand,</hi> or a <hi>right Eye:</hi> or as the ſpots to a Leopard, or skin to an <hi>Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian.</hi> This ſin, what ever it be, is the <hi>plague</hi> of thy heart, the moſt Mortal <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe</hi> of thy Soul, and thou muſt ſet thy ſelf with all thy might, both to find it out, and caſt it out, and mortifie it. 'Twas <hi>Davids</hi> Argument for his uprightneſs, that he kept himſelf from his own ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, <hi>Pſal.</hi> xviii. 23. <hi>I was alſo upright be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and I kept my ſelf from mine
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:107489:42"/> iniquity.</hi> And ſo muſt thou if ever thou expect acceptance with God.</p>
            <p>'Tis bad to be <hi>forced,</hi> or <hi>raviſhed,</hi> by <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Satan:</hi> 'tis worſe to <hi>yield</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to one act of <hi>defilement,</hi> or Spiritual Uncleanneſs: but 'tis worſt of all to be married to them, and this thou art by foſtering a Boſome <hi>darling</hi> ſin. This yields the conſtant uſe of <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> to his impure embraces. This keeps <hi>Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion</hi> for him, and opens the Door as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as he knocks, and he enters in and dwells there. <hi>Davids</hi> luſt to <hi>Bathſhebah,</hi> tho very foul, is called a <hi>Way-faring</hi> man and a <hi>Traveller,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> xii. 4. But where a <hi>darling</hi> ſin is harboured, there <hi>Satan</hi> is at <hi>Home</hi> in his own <hi>Houſe.</hi> This makes thy condition almoſt deſperate, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but a ſpeedy <hi>Divorce</hi> can prevent its being altogether ſo.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, Diſintagle and unchain thy heart from the inordinate love and cares of the things of this world. Account thy ſelf a <hi>Stranger</hi> and a <hi>Pilgrim</hi> here. Know that this is not thy reſt, thou haſt here <hi>no continuing place.</hi> But eſpecially take Gods. Counſel to <hi>Hezekiah, Iſa.</hi> xxxviii. 1. <hi>Set thine houſe in order, for thou ſhalt die, and not live.</hi> Prevent in time of <hi>Health,</hi> the diſtractions the unſetledneſs of thy
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:107489:43"/> worldly Affairs may and will give thee in the <hi>laſt Stage</hi> of thy life: leave nothing which may hinder thy following Chriſt readily, without once looking back, when he is about to lead thee out of this world. <hi>Remember</hi> Lots <hi>Wife.</hi> Luke xvii. 32. <hi>Readineſs</hi> to go into another world, Suppoſes <hi>Readineſs</hi> to go out of this.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Call in the aſſiſtance and help of others. 'Tis the Character of a wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that he is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> inquiſitive. When <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> came Preaching Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and ſhewing them their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that the <hi>Ax was laid to the root of the tree: And that every tree that brought not forth good fruit ſhould be hewed down and caſt into the fire,</hi> Luke iii. 9.

And the <hi>Souldiers</hi> likewiſe demanded of him ſaying, <hi>What ſhall we do? verſe</hi> 14. Alſo Chriſts <hi>Hearers, John</hi> vi. 28. ſaid unto him, <hi>What ſhall we do, that we may work the works of God?</hi> And the afrighted <hi>Jayler</hi> cryed out, <hi>Sirs what muſt I do to be ſaved,</hi> Act. xvi. 30. But where's the man that moves ſuch queſtions now adays? Or <hi>asks the way to</hi> Zion? If you feel the leaſt
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:107489:43"/> grudging of a Diſtemper in your Bodies, the <hi>Phyſitian</hi> is ſent for preſently. Or fear a flaw in your Eſtates, you run to the <hi>Lawyer:</hi> but every man thinks himſelf <hi>Phyſitian</hi> skilful enough for his Souls Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers, and <hi>Lawyer</hi> good enough for his Title to Heaven. And tho <hi>The Prieſts lips ſhould preſerve knowledg, and the people ſhould enquire the Law at his mouth,</hi> becauſe he is the Meſſenger of the Lord of Hoſts, <hi>Mal.</hi> ii. 7. Yet tho he be <hi>A Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger one of a thouſand, an Interpreter to ſhew to man his uprightneſs,</hi> Job xxxiii. 23. To declare to him whether his Spiritual condition be good and ſafe, and ſuch as makes him <hi>ready</hi> for Chriſt, yet may he ſit in his ſtudy till he dye before any come to interrupt him with ſuch buſineſs.</p>
            <p>It's true indeed, it may be you will ſend for him when you are <hi>Sick,</hi> I blame not this, better then, than not at all; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it be not <hi>too late,</hi> as too oft it is. When the <hi>Phyſitian</hi> leaves you and gives you over as hopeleſs: and you are draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on, and have ſcarce any uſe of Sence or Reaſon left. As the <hi>Fooliſh Virgins</hi> beg for <hi>Oyl,</hi> when ſickneſs and the approaching pangs of death, gave them that ſmart Alarum. <hi>Behold the Bridegroom cometh, go ye forth to meet him.</hi> And then you would
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:107489:44"/> be getting, when you ſhould be uſing it, what your whole life was lent you for. And then you would be taught in one quarter of an hour, (and when the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſitions both of Body and Mind, have made you paſt learning, or at leaſt very <hi>unfit</hi> to learn) what is a Leſſon hard e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for many years, even the calmeſt and leaſt diſturbed of them: and when thou didſt injoy a ſound Mind in a ſound Body.</p>
            <p>I beſeech you friends reſolve me; nay rather reſolve your ſelves; if it be good to conſult your <hi>Spiritual Guides</hi> then, is it not better to do it ſooner? whilſt you are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to take their Counſel, and have time to follow it? and if they may do you good then, may they not do you more good in a <hi>fitter ſeaſon?</hi> Why then will you chuſe the leſs before the more, and the worſe before the better? I therefore with repeated importunity again intreat you call in all the help you can, both from experienced humble Chriſtians, who make it their buſineſs in good earneſt, to be <hi>ready</hi> for Chriſt themſelves. And alſo from your faithful Paſtors, <hi>Who watch for your ſouls.

            <p>Second Uſe Reprehenſion, I ſhall name three ſorts only to be reproved for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againſt the Truth we are handling.

Theſe <hi>Leviathans</hi> eſteeming our Scripture Artillery, as he in <hi>Job</hi> lxi. 27.28. <hi>Doth Iron, Braſs, and ſling-ſtones, as ſtubble, ſtraw or rotten wood.</hi> Tho God can make theſe feeble weapons, mighty in his time to pull down the ſtrongeſt holds of <hi>Satan.</hi>

            <p>Secondly, Thoſe who tho they believe theſe things in general, and approve them, and commend others for making <hi>ready</hi> for Chriſt: yet neglect the practice and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of them: reſting in ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon hopes, ſome faint deſires, ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward obſervances, ſome <hi>ineffectual</hi> half endeavours; and rather wiſh they were <hi>ready</hi> for Chriſt, than take care to be ſo: and will rather put it to the venture, than be at the pains of any Spiritual Induſtry to be <hi>ready</hi> in good earneſt, which is the very caſe of multitudes of common Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>
            <pb n="67" facs="tcp:107489:45"/>
            <p>Thirdly, Thoſe, who tho they are convinc'd they ought, and alſo reſolve they will <hi>get ready,</hi> and ſtick at nothing which may make them ſo; yet <hi>put</hi> off and <hi>delay</hi> from day to day, and year to year. <hi>Semper victuri,</hi> as <hi>Seneca</hi> calls them, all way about to do it, but never do it; <hi>always learning but never coming to the knowledg of the truth. Stick in the birth and therefore are unwiſe,</hi> Hoſ. xiii. 13. And indeed nothing makes a man a greater <hi>fool,</hi> or more proves him to be ſuch, than this, to know what ſhould be done, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to do it, and yet never ſet about it. And therefore God brands them with this <hi>reproachful Character</hi> of folly which men are ſo impatient of. He that was ſo very buſie in taking care for many years, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ears preſently <hi>Thou fool this night.</hi> And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o the <hi>Fooliſh Virgins</hi> who had <hi>Lamps</hi> and <hi>Veſſels</hi> to hold <hi>Oyl,</hi> yet filled them not. And indeed what folly greater, than for men to go to <hi>Hell</hi> with their Eyes open? To know their danger, and yet to <hi>play</hi> and <hi>dally</hi> with it till it ſurprize and ſnap them, and to ſtand where the Bullets fly thickeſt: and yet neither get an Armor, nor haſten their eſcape, to be out of reach of Gun-ſhot? What will, if this will not, prove men to be indeed fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly?</p>
            <pb n="68" facs="tcp:107489:46"/>
            <p>Third Uſe, <hi>Examination;</hi> Expect not from me here, a large enumeration of the ſigns of Grace: I deſign not that. But a brief tryal of thy <hi>readineſs</hi> for <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Try thy ſelf therefore, as to that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you be <hi>ready</hi> as the Text requires. There is no <hi>knowledg</hi> more neceſſary, or more worthy of a <hi>wiſe mans</hi> pains; than the knowledg of himſelf, and his Eſtate towards God. It hath obtained the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of a <hi>Celeſtial Aixome,</hi> even amongſt <hi>Heathens. Know thy ſelf. (è coelo deſcendit</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.) And queſtionleſs it may be obtained, if we believe either St. <hi>Peter</hi> or St. <hi>Paul,</hi> for the <hi>firſt</hi> bids us <hi>give dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to make our calling and election ſure,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> i. 10. Therefore ſurely he thought it feaſible. The <hi>ſecond</hi> injoyns us thus, <hi>Examine your ſelves whether you be in the Faith: prove your own ſelves: know you not your own ſelves, how that Chriſt is in you, except you be Reprobates?</hi> 2 Cor. xiii. 5. Doubtleſs therefore he judged we might without ſpecial <hi>Revelation,</hi> even by ſerious ſelf-examination, know this of our ſelves.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Therefore try it, by the <hi>verdict</hi> of thy own <hi>Conſcience,</hi> ask it ſoberly, and let it anſwer freely, and it will ſpeak and not lye. Great is the force of <hi>Conſcience</hi> on
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:107489:46"/> either ſide, both to acquit and to condemn, <hi>Rom.</hi> ii. 15. <hi>Their Conſcience bearing witneſs, and their thoughts accuſing or excuſing one another.</hi> And if the blind <hi>Conſciences</hi> of the darkned <hi>Gentiles,</hi> had this power, how much more the <hi>Conſciences</hi> of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> enlightned by the Goſpel, and aſſiſted, at leaſt by the common influences of the Holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>Bring in thy <hi>Bill</hi> therefore, to this <hi>Grand Inqueſt:</hi> before theſe, <hi>mille teſtes,</hi> thouſand Witneſſes. 'Twill not write <hi>Ignoramus</hi> on it. 'Tis <hi>Magni Judicii pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicium,</hi> a <hi>Petty Seſſions</hi> to the great <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſize,</hi> a previous Judgment to the laſt and moſt awful one. Neither bribe it, nor ſtop its mouth, and it will ſpeak as he would have it, whoſe <hi>Deputy</hi> it is. <hi>The ſpirit of a man is the Candle of the Lord, ſearching all the inward parts of the belly, Prov.</hi> xx. 27. That which is moſt hid and ſecret, this light will diſcover, find out, and manifeſt. The things of a man, the ſpirit of a man, which is in him, knows: tho none elſe can, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ii. 11. And therefore the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of our <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> yields great <hi>rejoycing:</hi> when it witneſſes our <hi>Simplicity</hi> and <hi>Godly Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> i. 12. And St. <hi>John</hi> tells us, <hi>If our heart condemn us not, then have we
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:107489:47"/> confidence towards God,</hi> 1 Eph. iii. 21. Weigh not thy ſelf therefore in the <hi>falſe ballance</hi> of other mens Opinions. <hi>Nec te quaeſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veris extra,</hi> as <hi>Perſius</hi> could adviſe. But get into thy <hi>Cloſet,</hi> retire, be ſtill, <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune with thine own heart,</hi> Pſal. iv. 4. and let it ſpeak freely, 'twill anſwer like an Oracle of God.</p>
            <p>Interrogate thy heart in this, or ſuch like manner: Have I with deſire deſired? Have I with a thirſty Appetite panted after this <hi>readineſs</hi> for Chriſt? Have I with conſtant and reſtleſs diligence endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to attain it? Have I arrived, at leaſt, at ſome ſetled hope, that if Chriſt ſhould now come, I ſhould be <hi>found</hi> of him in <hi>peace?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, By the ſcope and tendency of thy life, by the Fruits thou beareſt: <hi>Examine</hi> whether thou art a Tree, which if now cut down, muſt be Fuel for the fire which ſhall burn for ever; or build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Timber, for the Houſe not made with hands, Eternal in the Heavens! If others may know us, and we may know them, by the <hi>Fruits</hi> which either bear: why may we not much rather know our ſelves by them? the frame of our hearts, and the ſcope of our lives, are great <hi>indications,</hi> whither we are going. If our hearts
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:107489:47"/> be in Heaven, and our Converſation be in Heaven, our ſoul, ſhall be received there. If thou fix thy <hi>choice,</hi> thy delight and love, on right-hand bleſſings; thou ſhalt ſtand at Chriſts Right hand, at the <hi>laſt day.</hi> If thou walk in the <hi>ſtraight</hi> and <hi>narrow</hi> way, it will lead thee to, and into, the <hi>ſtraight gate,</hi> which gives en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into Life. But the <hi>broad</hi> way of Hell, will never lead any man to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, By thy willingneſs to dye: thy <hi>looking</hi> for, and <hi>haſtning</hi> to the <hi>day</hi> of God: and <hi>loving</hi> the <hi>appearance</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Not but that Nature may recoil and ſhrink: and the fleſh may draw back, and be loath to part: for even where the <hi>Spirit</hi> is <hi>willing</hi> the <hi>Fleſh</hi> is <hi>weak:</hi> but upon <hi>ſedate recollection,</hi> the willingneſs of the Spirit will fortifie the weakneſs of the Fleſh; and cry out Go forth my Soul, for he is a gracious Lord, thou art going now to meet.</p>
            <p>Fourth Uſe, Exhortation. I haſten to that in which I deſigned the chief im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of this truth; that is, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort and quicken you, to the ſpeedieſt diligence and care, to get <hi>ready</hi> for Chriſts <hi>coming.</hi> And tho I deſire to work both upon your Conſciences and your Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:107489:48"/> to ſet before you your Obedience and your Intereſt: to urge you in point of duty, and in point of wiſdom, and to preſs you to avoid both the ſin and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, <hi>procraſtination</hi> will involve you in: yet I ſhall not curiouſly diſtinguiſh the motives, to rank each Series by themſelves. But as God hath <hi>twiſted</hi> his <hi>glory</hi> and our <hi>happineſs</hi> ſo cloſe together, in great wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and mercy, that we cannot promote the one, but we advance the other: nor neglect the one, but we deſtroy and loſe the other. So is it in our <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>danger:</hi> they are prevented, or incur'd together: and therefore I may well wreath into one <hi>chain,</hi> the motives which concern either of them, to draw you out of your <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay:</hi> and <hi>twiſt</hi> them into one <hi>cord,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to quicken and accelerate your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>And not to heap up here, the many Scriptures, which ſpeak ſo home and plainly to this matter: but to leave them to fall in, to inforce each motive, to which they more properly belong; I ſhall begin with that which ſtands ſo near the <hi>Text,</hi> that it is urged in the ſame <hi>verſe,</hi> as a reaſon to inforce the duty. Be ye therefore <hi>ready,</hi> for, or <hi>becauſe, The Son of man cometh, at an hour, when ye think not.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="73" facs="tcp:107489:48"/>
            <p>The firſt Motive is taken from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of the time of our <hi>death,</hi> and our Lords coming. And the Inference is ſo obvious, that the Light of Nature, and common Reaſon hath clearly diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered it, and excellently inforced it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou knoweſt not, ſaith <hi>Seneca,</hi> where death will expect thee, expect thou it in every place: and becauſe thou knows not when it will meet thee, do thou look for it at every time. And he hath ſo many appoſite paſſages, in one <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle,</hi> written upon the occaſion of the ſudden death of <hi>Cornelius Senecio,</hi> 'twere eaſie to fill a <hi>Page</hi> with what might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently extracted thence, and looks more like a <hi>Chriſtian Homily,</hi> than the writing of an <hi>Heathen Moraliſt.</hi> But they that can, and will conſult the whole, may find it, <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 101. in his works. For we need not go down to <hi>Askelon</hi> to whet our ſtiles, to make them pungent on this ſubject. We may Feather theſe Arrows from the Wing of the Holy Dove. No Nail is faſtned more ſurely, or driven to the head with more reiterated ſtroaks, by the hand of the Spirit, than this; to quicken us to be preſently, to be always <hi>ready:</hi> to watch, to have our Loins gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, our Shooes on our Feet, our Staves
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:107489:49"/> in our Hands, our Lights burning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we know not the time, neither the hour of the day, nor the Watch in the night, wherein our Lord will come. And he that may come in any one, ſhould be prepared for in every one. It ſeems to be the very deſign and reaſon, for which God hath hidden from us the knowledg of <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Judgment:</hi> to prevent ſecurity and putting off our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring for it, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> v. 2. <hi>Your ſelves know perfectly that the day of the Lord ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as a thief in the night, therefore let us not ſleep as do others, but let us watch and be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> verſe 6. So 2 Pet. iii. 10. <hi>The day of God will come as a thief in the night.</hi> See the inference, <hi>verſe</hi> 11.12. <hi>Therefore what manner of perſons ought we to be in all holy Converſation and Godlineſs? looking for, and haſtning to the coming of the day of God.</hi> That is, haſtning to be fit for it, So in <hi>Rev.</hi> iii. 3. <hi>If thou ſhalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou ſhalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.</hi> I'le content my ſelf with naming but one place more, Mark xiii. 32, 33, 36. <hi>Of that day and that hour knoweth no man. Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is. Watch ye therefore (for ye know not when the maſter of the houſe cometh, at
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:107489:49"/> Even or at Midnight, or at the Cock crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or in the morning) leſt coming ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, he find you ſleeping. And what I ſay to you I ſay to all, Watch.</hi> Many go to bed well, and ſleep their long ſleep, awake not till in another world. Many go abroad well but their journey leads them to their long home, and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn not to the place from whence they went. What is another mans caſe may be thine, therefore be thou ready.</p>
            <p>Secondly, All <hi>delay</hi> is dangerous. If thy Houſe be on fire a timely diligence may quench it, but a ſhort neglect may leave thee both poor and harbourleſs. A breach in a Sea wall, if left but open to the next Tide, may prove irreparable, and drown a Country. If an invading E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy have time to intrench, 'twill be har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if not paſt thy skill, to drive him out. A green Wound may be eaſily Healed, but if thou let it alone till it Rancle, Feſter, and Gangreen; it may coſt thee thy life. If a Suit be Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt thee, it is dangerous to let it run till it come to Execution, or an Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary: theſe and an hundred ſuch alluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons might be given, to ſhew the caſe 'twixt God and us. His wrath is kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>kiſs the Son</hi> leſt it break out into a
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:107489:50"/> 
               <hi>conſuming fire.</hi> Sin and <hi>Satan</hi> have inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thy ſoul, let them not intrench and fortifie, but drive them out quickly. Thou haſt wounded thy Conſcience, get quickly ſome <hi>Balm</hi> of <hi>Gilead,</hi> ſome Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of Chriſts Blood before it Feſter, Gangreen, and be incurable.</p>
            <p>God hath a Controverſie with thee, and is entring his Action. <hi>Agree</hi> with <hi>thine adverſary quickly, whilſt thou art in the way with him, leſt at any time the adverſary deliver thee to the Judg, and the Judg deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thee to the Officer, and thou be caſt into priſon, verily I ſay unto thee, thou ſhalt by no means come out thence, till thou haſt paid the laſt farthing,</hi> Matth. v. 25, 26. And of how much greater importance the matter is, ſo much more dangerous is it to <hi>delay.</hi> The folly is leſs to run an hazard where the loſs is ſmall, and eaſiely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairable: but 'tis madneſs to defer where Eſtate, and Liberty, and Life, and All's at ſtake, and this caſe is more than ſuch: for thy Soul, and Heaven, and God are loſt for ever, if thou be ſurprized un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, This <hi>delay</hi> is ſinful, as well as dangerous; all Commands, relating to it, are in preſent force. The Impera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Mood hath no Future Tenſe. They
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:107489:50"/> are not like ſome human Laws, whoſe Obligation Commenceth not, till ſome months after they were Enacted, theſe bind <hi>ſemper,</hi> and <hi>ad ſemper,</hi> all ways, and at all times: for 'tis never lawful to be <hi>unready</hi> for Chriſt. To be Unjuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, Unſanctified, Unmindful of his coming, in an eſtate of enmity againſt him, or alienation from him.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, There are farther many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite clear and plain Commands, injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this preſent and ſpeedy perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance. <hi>When thou voweſt a vow to God, defer not to pay it: for he hath no pleaſure in fools; pay that which thou haſt vowed. Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is that thou ſhouldeſt not vow, than that thou ſhouldeſt vow, and not pay. Suffer not thy mouth to cauſe thy fleſh to ſin,</hi> Eccl. v. 4, 5, 6. Where note, that to defer pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is not to pay. Now let us apply this to our great <hi>Baptiſmal Vow,</hi> in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which, I ſhewed, our <hi>readineſs</hi> for Chriſt conſiſts. And here's an expreſs Command not to defer our being <hi>ready</hi> for him. <hi>Eccleſiaſt.</hi> xviii. 22. <hi>Defer not until death to be juſtified, is the good counſel of the Son of</hi> Syrack, and very conſonant to the Commands of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Agree with thine adverſary quickly, whilſt thou art in the way with him.</hi> Sin hath
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:107489:51"/> made God thy <hi>enemy,</hi> this life is the <hi>way</hi> in which thou art paſſing on to Death and Judgment, as the end of it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in thy life before death; and becauſe thou haſt no aſſurance of thy life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the preſent time, (for who knows what a day may bring forth) therefore preſently <hi>agree</hi> and make thy <hi>peace</hi> with him. And as <hi>Ananias</hi> ſaid to <hi>Saul,</hi> Acts xxii. 16. <hi>Ariſe why tarryeſt thou? be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,</hi> improve thy <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> waſh away thy ſins; and call upon the name of the Lord. And what thou doeſt do quickly, leſt God take thy <hi>delaying,</hi> for a deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to obey his will.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, 'Tis a ſin againſt the Light of Nature, which teaches all to haſten <hi>ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily,</hi> into ſome place of ſafe-guard when they are in danger. Not only men by uſe of common Reaſon, but the inferior Creatures yield <hi>Obedience</hi> to this Law by Natural Inſtinct: how will they run, how will they fly to ſhelter when what would hurt them, either purſues, or hovers over them. Shall the <hi>Cony</hi> ſhoot into its <hi>Burrow</hi> in the <hi>Rock,</hi> as ſoon as ere it ſpies a Dog? And ſhall not that <hi>Bandog</hi> of Hell, (from which <hi>David</hi> Prays to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, <hi>my darling from the dog,</hi>) Which hunts for our ſouls, ſcare us to the <hi>Rock
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:107489:51"/> of Ages,</hi> and the holes of that Rock, the <hi>Wounds</hi> of Chriſt? Shall the ſilly <hi>Chicken,</hi> by the ſhaddow of the <hi>Kite,</hi> be driven to its damm: and ſhall not we betake our ſelves to him, who offers <hi>to gather us as an Hen gathers her Chickens under her wings:</hi> when that great <hi>Vulture,</hi> that preys on men, is ready to gripe us, with his fiery <hi>Talons?</hi> Oh how has ſin, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unman'd us, but <hi>degraded</hi> us, below the baſeſt of the Creatures: and <hi>erazed</hi> and <hi>Cancelled,</hi> the moſt legible of all the <hi>Laws</hi> of Nature, the Law of ſelf-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation?</p>
            <p>Sixthly, 'Tis an error againſt common <hi>Prudence,</hi> and the Principle thou acteſt by in leaſt concernments. There thy Rule is, better too ſoon, than too late. If for the <hi>Fair</hi> or <hi>Market,</hi> if for a <hi>Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> or to ſee a <hi>Show</hi> or <hi>Play,</hi> How early wilt thou riſe? How timely wilt thou go to get a place? And ſtay two hours for them, rather than venture to come one minute too late, and hazard to loſe that which will not ſtay for thee: yea to meet thy Companions in ſin, and to gratifie thy Luſts? How afraid art thou to come too late. And yet for God and thy Soul, thou thinkeſt all's in good time, tho thou ſet out never ſo late. What is, if this be
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:107489:52"/> not, to be <hi>wiſe to do evil, but to have no knowledg to do good?</hi> And ſurely this will be no ſmall aggravation of mens faults, when it appears they wanted <hi>Prudential</hi> Rules of Conduct in nothing, but the things of God; which argues their deſpiſing of them, as if not worthy to imploy their wits, or thoughts about. That man in the <hi>Goſpel</hi> who could contrive ſo prudently, to fit his <hi>Barns</hi> to his <hi>Crop,</hi> and both to his <hi>Belly,</hi> and all to his <hi>Luſts, Take thy caſe eat drink and be merry:</hi> How doth God reproach him, and diſappoint him with a vengeance? For not being at leaſt, as wiſe for Heaven, as for Earth, <hi>Thou fool this night ſhall thy ſoul be required of thee: then whoſe ſhall thoſe things be?</hi> For <hi>ſo is every one, who lays up treaſure to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and is not rich towards God,</hi> Luke xii. 20, 21.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, 'Tis a ſin againſt the <hi>Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> of all wiſe and good men. All the <hi>Wiſe Virgins</hi> were ready for the <hi>Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grooms</hi> coming. 'Tis the <hi>Character</hi> of a wiſe man, to take time by the fore-lock. <hi>Soloman,</hi> ſaith, <hi>A wiſe mans Eyes are in his head,</hi> Eccl. ii. 14. To ſee before him. And God expreſly, <hi>Deut.</hi> xxxii. 29. <hi>O that they were wiſe, that they underſtood this, that they would conſider their latter end,</hi> to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:107489:52"/> do this then is to be wiſe. So, <hi>Be wiſe O ye Kings,</hi> what proves them ſo? <hi>To ſerve the Lord with fear, to kiſs the ſon left he be angry and they periſh from the way,</hi> Pſal. ii. 10, 11, 12. And <hi>David,</hi> that man after Gods own heart, (and ſurely nothing is more according to the heart of God) gives this teſtimony of himſelf. <hi>I made haſt, and prolonged not the time to keep thy Commandments,</hi> Pſal. cxix. 60. And <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> when God made a <hi>Covenant</hi> with him, deferred not to <hi>Seal</hi> it, with the painful <hi>Seal</hi> of <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> the ſelf ſame day, as is Emphatically noted, <hi>Gen.</hi> xvii. 23. And when he was <hi>tempted</hi> to offer up <hi>Iſaac: He roſe up early in the morning</hi> to go about that hard work, <hi>Gen.</hi> xxii. 3. And the Diſciples when Chriſt called them, <hi>immediately left the Ship and their Father, and followed him,</hi> Matth. iv. 22. And when God called the <hi>Jayler,</hi> Act. xvi. <hi>The ſame hour of the night he was Baptized: he and his ſtraight ways,</hi> verſe 33. See this Cloud of witneſſes, and go not in a different way from what they went in, leſt thou never arrive at the place they are gone to.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, 'Tis a ſin againſt a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>warnings,</hi> and loud <hi>calls</hi> of <hi>Providence,</hi> Every <hi>Knell</hi> thou heareſt, ſhould toll thee

Much more when <hi>death</hi> comes into thy Houſe, thy Bed, thy Bowels, and ſnatches away thoſe halves, thoſe pieces of thy ſelf, an Husband, Wife, Child. Yea every ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptom of thy own decaying <hi>Tabernacle; Gray hairs are here and there upon thee:</hi> the <hi>dimneſs</hi> of thy <hi>ſight</hi> gives the a proſpect of approaching darkneſs: the <hi>faltring</hi> of thy <hi>ſpeech</hi> minds thee of the <hi>Houſe</hi> of ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: the ſtooping of thy <hi>back</hi> and <hi>head,</hi> ſhows thy inclining to thy <hi>Grave:</hi> and thy feebleneſs to go may remember thee, that ere long thou muſt be carryed forth by others.

            <p>Ninthly, 'Tis a ſin againſt, not only, <hi>means</hi> of <hi>Conviction,</hi> but <hi>actual</hi> Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yea and reſolutions made on that Conviction. I am perſuaded few men live under any tolerable Preaching of the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> Who do not ſee a need of making <hi>ready</hi> for Chriſt: and do

And their <hi>modò, modò,</hi> was <hi>ſine modo,</hi> and when they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to riſe, like the <hi>Sluggard</hi> they lye down again, to take the t'other <hi>Napp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> Death takes them Napping indeed, and betwixt their making good <hi>reſolutions,</hi> to do what they ought; and making good thoſe <hi>reſolutions</hi> by performing them; Chriſt comes and takes them away, and their <hi>purpoſes</hi> and <hi>promiſes</hi> of amendment, ſerve for nothing, but to aggravate their <hi>Condemnation,</hi> for breaking of them. And aſſuredly, nothing will ſharpen the <hi>Sting,</hi> and <hi>envenom</hi> the teeth of the <hi>never-dying Worm,</hi> more than the remembrance of ſuch convictions ſtifled, and ſuch reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions broken by <hi>delay,</hi> till 'twas too late to perform them.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, This work can never be done <hi>too ſoon,</hi> therefore there is no pretence left for <hi>delay,</hi> for fear of being <hi>ready</hi> too
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:107489:54"/> early: thou canſt never be <hi>Juſtified</hi> too ſoon, <hi>Sanctified</hi> too ſoon, be good too ſoon, be at <hi>Peace</hi> with God too ſoon. I know indeed there are wretched Notions of, and prejudices againſt <hi>Religion,</hi> which the <hi>Devil</hi> would infuſe into mens minds, from whence it would follow, that 'tis ſafe, yea better to let it alone, till we are Old, or come to dye.</p>
            <p>As that <hi>Religion</hi> is only an Art of dying happily, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is an <hi>Auſtere</hi> Maſter, and thou ſhalt never ſee merry day in his ſervice. That 'twill make thee <hi>Melancholy,</hi> Emaſculate thy Spirit with Superſtitious fears, render thee moroſe, unſociable, a <hi>burden</hi> to thy ſelf and others. But theſe curſed <hi>ſlanders</hi> ſmell ſo rank of the <hi>Father</hi> of lies, 'tis needleſs to confute them amongſt ſober Chriſtians. Yet in a word,</p>
            <p>Religion is a Diſcipline of living ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily, in order to dying happily, of walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with God here, that we may reſt with him hereafter. And <hi>Chriſt is meek and lowly in heart,</hi> Matth xi, will neither pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke nor deſpiſe his ſervants, and <hi>his yoak is eaſie, and burden light</hi> to thoſe who wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly come under them, and will neither gawl their Necks, nor break their Backs: there is no true <hi>Peace</hi> but in <hi>reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:107489:54"/> with God; nor Joy but to the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, for light <hi>Is ſown for the Righteous, and gladneſs for the upright in heart,</hi> Pſalm xcvii. 11. <hi>Thou haſt put gladneſs in my heart more than when corn and wine increaſe, Pſalm</hi> iv. 7.

The <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> of God (of his Grace) <hi>is Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Peace and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Yea believing in Chriſt, before we ſee him, intitles us at leaſt, <hi>to joy unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and full of glory,</hi> and tho others will not be perſuaded of it, becauſe they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver felt it, rather let them be perſuaded to be fit to feel it.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Soloman</hi> hath told them, <hi>a ſtranger doth not intermedle with it.</hi> But in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves all <hi>wiſdoms</hi> ways <hi>are pleaſantneſs, and all her paths are peace.</hi> And not to hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our the reſt of thoſe paultry ſlanders, with a particular confutation: that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>unman</hi> us in a baſe ſence, which ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther makes us more than men in a noble one: what rectifies, refines, exalts our <hi>Reaſon,</hi> what moderates, directs, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dues our paſſions to its conduct. What inlightens, purifies, and pacifies our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences. What bows and melts down our wills, into ſubjection to the will of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:107489:55"/> God. And in a word, renues to the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage</hi> of Chriſt, and makes us <hi>partakers</hi> of the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> can not be guilty of what's objected. And all this, is done by that, which makes us <hi>ready</hi> for Chriſt, and therefore we can never either ſeek or find it too ſoon.</p>
            <p>Eleventhly, But it may be done <hi>too late,</hi> that is, be gone about too late: as thouſands have found by ſad experience. And O that their <hi>harms</hi> may be our <hi>war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,</hi> that we increaſe not that unhappy number. The <hi>Fooliſh Virgins</hi> would have <hi>Oyl at laſt,</hi> were it to be either begged or bought: and afterward they came, <hi>Mat.</hi> xxv. 11. <hi>With their Lord, Lord, but then the door was ſhut.</hi> 'Tis ill leaving theſe things to an after-game. Remember <hi>Eſau,</hi> who afterward <hi>would have inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the bleſſing</hi> (which he deſpiſed before) but then he <hi>was rejected, though he ſought it earneſtly with tears,</hi> Heb. xii. 17.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When once the Maſter of the Houſe is riſen and hath ſhut the door,</hi> you may ſtrive to enter, but muſt loſe your labour, <hi>Luke</hi> xiii. 24, 25. I pray Read with conſideration and Holy fear, <hi>Prov.</hi> i. from the twenty-fourth to the end, and note eſpecially <hi>verſe</hi> 28. <hi>Then ſhall they call upon me but I will not anſwer: they ſhall ſeek me early but
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:107489:55"/> they ſhall not find me.</hi> What they thought all in good time, and even early, for this work, they'l find to their ſhame, to their ſorrow and eternal ruin: was much too late in Gods eſteem. Tho God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs'd to accept us when we come, He hath no where promiſs'd more time in which to come: the preſent is all we are ſure of, <hi>Now is the accepted time,</hi> 2 Cor. vi. 2.</p>
            <p>Twelfthly, 'Tis more than time 'twere done already. If we wake not, if we riſe not of our own accord, 'tis high time to do it, when our Maſter calls us: if we go not out to meet him, it atleaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes us to open to him when he comes and knocks. If we prevent him not by offering free poſſeſſion of our hearts, there's no excuſe left if we reſiſt him, when he ſtrives to take it, If our own <hi>hunger,</hi> and even <hi>ſtarving</hi> at the <hi>Hoggs</hi> Trough (with the <hi>prodigal</hi>) will not drive us to him: Yet at leaſt the killing his <hi>Fatlings,</hi> preparing his <hi>Wine,</hi> making a <hi>Feaſt</hi> and inviting us ſo kindly, <hi>Come for all things are ready,</hi> ſhould do it, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten a mutual <hi>readineſs</hi> in us: now God hath long called us, <hi>Turn ye turn ye why will ye dye?</hi> Come unto me and I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh you. <hi>The Spirit and the Bride ſay
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:107489:56"/> come. How long ye ſimple ones will ye love ſimplicity?</hi> He hath long ſtood at the <hi>door</hi> and <hi>knockt,</hi> even <hi>till his head be wet with the rain, and his locks with the dew of the night.</hi> He hath long ſtriven by his <hi>word,</hi> by his <hi>Spirit,</hi> by his <hi>Ordinances,</hi> by his <hi>Providences:</hi> by his <hi>Mercies,</hi> by his <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> as we ſay by fair means, and by force. He hath long ſince made fat Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for us, and moſt lovingly invited us, and told us all is <hi>ready,</hi> there's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wanting at the <hi>Feaſt</hi> but Gueſts. And is it not more than time, that we had anſwered, opened, yeilded, come long ſince; when he does even long to ſee us there: when ſhall it once be?</p>
            <p>Thirteenthly, The ſooner the better, admit thy <hi>delay</hi> ſhould not prove damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, it will certainly be very detrimental, thou'lt loſe much by it, tho thou loſe not all. The ſooner thou comeſt, the welcomer thou ſhalt be. The <hi>youngeſt</hi> Diſciple was the <hi>beloved</hi> Diſciple. <hi>His ſoul deſires the firſt ripe fruits.</hi> Gods rod was of <hi>Almond</hi> wood, the Tree which <hi>Bloſſoms</hi> firſt of all the <hi>Plants. Joſiahs</hi> great <hi>encomium</hi> was: <hi>He ſought the Lord God of his Fathers when he was young,</hi> but twice eight years old, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> xxxiv. 3. 'Tis argued amongſt <hi>Divines</hi> from what <hi>Age</hi>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:107489:56"/> children are accountable to God for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſome ſay from five, ſome ſay from ſeven years old: but all conclude that from the time they can diſcern betwixt Good and evil, they are bound to refuſe what's evil, and to chuſe what's good. <hi>Again,</hi> the ſooner thou art <hi>ready,</hi> the ſtronger will thy <hi>Grace,</hi> the ſurer will thy <hi>Comforts</hi> be, and the greater thy <hi>Reward</hi> in Heaven, as thou haſt longer glorified God on Earth: and all the while thou ſtayeſt <hi>unready,</hi> thou art gathering either <hi>Woormwood,</hi> or <hi>Hemlock,</hi> the beſt is <hi>bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> the worſt is <hi>deadly;</hi> bitter Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance if thou be ever <hi>ready.</hi> And thou wilt cry out with <hi>Auſtin, Nimis ſero te amare coepi:</hi> too late, O Lord, did I begin to love thee. Rather therefore reſolve with the <hi>Orator, Nolo tantiemere poeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam,</hi> He not purchaſe <hi>Repentance</hi> at ſo dear a rate, or deadly damnation if thou be never ready.</p>
            <p>Fourteenthly, The longer thou ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, the harder will the work be, each day lays on a ſtone upon the Wall of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, thy ſins are building betwixt God and thee; and the higher 'tis raiſed the harder it will be to climb over. Thy iniquities increaſe the Floods, like <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiels</hi> waters, and the ſtream which was
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:107489:57"/> at firſt but <hi>Ankle high,</hi> or to the <hi>Knees,</hi> and fordable at leaſt, will become impaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and in the deep waters they ſhall not come nigh him. The longer thou art going from God the farther off thou'lt be, and the more difficult will thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn be found. Rooted Habits are hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eradicated, and <hi>Cuſtom</hi> in ſin becomes a ſecond Nature. And as eaſily may the <hi>Leopard change his ſpots:</hi> or the <hi>Ethiopian put off his skin,</hi> as he <hi>learn</hi> to do <hi>good</hi> who is <hi>accuſtomed</hi> to do <hi>evil, Jer.</hi> xiii. 23. Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom in ſin, will take away the ſence of ſin, and harden the heart like the neather Mill-ſtone. Therefore <hi>Exhort one another dayly, while it is called to day,</hi> yea rouſe up your ſelves <hi>leſt any of you be hardened through the deceitfulneſs of ſin,</hi> Heb. iii. 13. <hi>Nemo repente fit turpiſſimus,</hi> no man arrives at height of wickedneſs all on the ſudden, but by degrees. Even <hi>depraved</hi> Nature hath ſome <hi>modeſty</hi> left to reſtrain it, and that muſt be bafled to make it <hi>impudent</hi> in ſin, and <hi>braze</hi> its fore-head, to be paſt bluſhing. A freſh water-Souldier dops his head and ſhrinks at the diſcharge of ſingle Muskets, but he that's fluſht with often coming ſafely off, deſpiſeth Vollies, and marches erect where the Bullets fall like a ſtorm of Hail, and at laſt will run
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:107489:57"/> upon the mouth of Canons. Experience breeds hope in evil as well as in good: and becauſe men have long continued <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready</hi> for Chriſt, and yet found no danger in it, they flatter themſelves they never ſhall. And <hi>Becauſe ſentence againſt an evil work is not executed ſpeedily: therefore the heart of the ſons of men is fully ſet in them to do evil,</hi> Eccl. viii: 11. And ſo what was always hard to do: at length be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes next to impoſſible to be done, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially confidering,</p>
            <p>Fifthteenthly, Thy ſtrength declines, as well as thy work grows more difficult; and according to the old Verſe, <hi>Qui non eſt hodie, cras minus aptus erit.</hi> He that's unfit to day, will be more unfit to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; for beſides the decays of Nature, which are not to be deſpiſed, where the <hi>work</hi> is wholly to begin, the offers of Grace will be more rare and faint, the motions of the Spirit will be leſs fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, leſs importunate. He hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther delight nor liſt to knock at that <hi>door,</hi> which hath been barr'd ſo long againſt him; nor to expoſe himſelf to new repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, where he hath been ſo often grieved, and his help rejected, and ere long he will be gone for ever, and woe be to thee when he departs from thee.</p>
            <pb n="92" facs="tcp:107489:58"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Si ter pulſanti nemo reſpondet, abito.</hi> The <hi>Courts</hi> on Earth <hi>Record</hi> the third contempt for contumacy, and proceed to Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. And doth the <hi>Court</hi> of Heaven keep no <hi>Records? He ſeals up thine iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in a bag:</hi> and are not theſe things <hi>writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in his Book.</hi> What folly is it, to lay the heavieſt burden on the weakeſt beaſt! to leave that care and work to thy decrepid <hi>Age:</hi> When the <hi>Graſhopper ſhall be a burden,</hi> which the vigour of thy <hi>youth</hi> can ſcarcely ſtruggle with?</p>
            <p>Sixteenthly, Thou wilt not be ſerved thus thy ſelf, do as thou wouldſt be done to. How irkſome to thee is a loytring ſervant? <hi>As vinegar to the teeth, and ſmoak to the Eyes, ſo is a ſluggard to them that ſend him,</hi> Prov. x. 26. Thou expecteſt thy ſervant ſhall attend on thee, before he ſerve himſelf. <hi>Which of you having a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant Plowing, or feeding Cattle, will ſay unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, go ſit down to meat? And will not rather ſay unto him, firſt make ready where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I may ſup, and gird thy ſelf and ſerve me, till I have eaten and drunken: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ward thou ſhalt eat and drink;</hi> thou'lt rid thy Houſe of him, who will ſerve himſelf before his Maſter: and make him ſtay his leiſure, and what ſhall God
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:107489:58"/> do to ſuch an one? His are a <hi>willing people,</hi> and all <hi>delay</hi> implies unwillingneſs. We would never do, what we are loath to do, if we durſt omit it, not love but fear begets ſuch motion: and 'tis love to our work, which makes our working ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable; God had as lieve you ſhould do nothing, as do what you do, without, or againſt your heart.</p>
            <p>Seventeenthly, Nay! You do not only hate <hi>delays</hi> in men: but you cannot bear them at the hand of God; if you be in diſtreſs, in pain, or danger, you cry out, <hi>O God make ſpeed to ſave us: O Lord make haſt to help us, anſwer me ſpeedily,</hi> Lord tarry not, and if he do you grow im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate. <hi>Make haſt O God to deliver me: make haſt to help me O Lord,</hi> Pſal. lxx. 1. <hi>Make haſt unto me O God, O Lord make no tarrying,</hi> verſe 5. if not half im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient, <hi>Hear me ſpeedily, O Lord, my ſpirit faileth,</hi> Pſal. clxiii. 7. <hi>My ſoul is vexed, but thou, O Lord, how long,</hi> Pſalm vi. 3. <hi>How long wilt thou forget me, O Lord, for ever! How long wilt thou hide thy face from me? How long ſhall I take Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel in my ſoul dayly? How long ſhall my enemy be exalted over me? Conſider and hear me, O Lord, my God,</hi> Pſalm xiii. 1, 2, 3. If not quite ſo, and deſperate, with that
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:107489:59"/> wicked King. <hi>Why ſhould I ſtay, or wait for the Lord any longer,</hi> 2 Kings vi. 33. And if God ſhould when thou roareſt for horror of Conſcience, or art as on a Rack with exquiſite pains of <hi>Gout,</hi> or <hi>Stone,</hi> or but the <hi>Tooth-Ache:</hi> anſwer thee with ſuch <hi>delays</hi> as thou doſt him; and ſay; why ſuch haſt, all in good time, I am not at leiſure, forty years hence, or twenty years hence I'le help and eaſe thee; be content, I can't come yet, but when I have nothing elſe to do I'le help thee. How would this <hi>hope deferred make thy heart ſick?</hi> And 'tis well if thou refrain <hi>Blaſpheming</hi> him, as one that mockt thee: and yet God muſt ſuffer all this at thine hand, be provoked and grieved forty years long, yea fifty, threeſcore years, and wait, and call, and cry, and reaſon with thee, and intreat thee, to return, to get <hi>ready</hi> for him, but all in vain, thou turneſt a deaf Ear to him, <hi>and art as the deaf Adder, which refuſeth to hear the voice of the charmer charming never ſo wiſely.</hi> And wilt neither dance to his piping, nor weep at his mourning to you. Conſider this you that forget God, how, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly you take it, to be forgotten of him: and you that <hi>delay</hi> ſo many years to be <hi>ready</hi> for him, how ill you can bear
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:107489:59"/> his <hi>delaying</hi> but a week or day, if he be not ready to relieve and help you in your fears and ſorrows.</p>
            <p>Eighteenthly, You'l not deal thus with others as you deal with God, as if 'twere only ſafe and faultleſs to deſpiſe him, not with your betters, good manners will not ſuffer that: you ſay, <hi>'Tis fitter you ſhould ſtay for them, than they for you.</hi> Not with a <hi>Friend</hi> or <hi>Neighbour; but will riſe at midnight, to lend him what he needs,</hi> or but to light his Candle. Not with an <hi>Enemy,</hi> but wilt <hi>Heap coals of fire on his head to melt him,</hi> or oblige him with preventing kindneſs: not with a <hi>Beaſt</hi> but if it Low for Food wilt ſerve it: or <hi>if it fall into a ditch, be it an</hi> Ox <hi>or</hi> Aſs, <hi>wilt ſtraightways pull it out, tho on the Sabbath day,</hi> Luke xiv. 5. Nay you will not make the <hi>Devil</hi> dance attendance, at the rate, you trifle with <hi>Almighty God,</hi> if he but whiſtle to you, you know his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and obey it, a nod, a beckon of his finger is enough; you are dry Tinder to the firſt ſpark of Temptation he caſt on you, and you are quickly in a flame. But to Gods Holy motions, tho they be hot as <hi>coals of Juniper,</hi> you are like <hi>green wood:</hi> no blowing will ſuffice to dry, or make you kindle. Nay, would I could
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:107489:60"/> ſay, that too many were not too quick and nimble for the <hi>Devil</hi> himſelf, ſave him the charge and trouble of a <hi>temptation;</hi> run to his work before he bids them, like high mettled Horſes, ſtart before the ſign can be given, and run full ſpeed without either Switch or Spur. And yet mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while quite foundred, and down right lame in the ways of God: that neither <hi>Spur</hi> nor <hi>Whip,</hi> can mend their pace. God hath not left himſelf without witneſs, that he might leave thee without excuſe: his <hi>grads</hi> are in thy ſides; his hand hath fixed them in thy very ſoul: for as he hath planted <hi>punitive affections</hi> in thee, to be his rods to whip thee for thy paſt offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſuch as ſhame and grief. So hath he <hi>quickning</hi> affections to excite thee to thy duty; ſuch as hope and fear, and yet thou wilt kick againſt theſe pricks, be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo hazardous, never ſo hard to do ſo. How often haſt thou felt theſe ſtings ſtrike to thy very heart, and yet like a reſtive Horſe, thou wilt rather winch, or kick, or run backward, or fall down, than go forward as thou oughteſt. When <hi>ſickneſs</hi> hath aſſaulted thee, and grim <hi>Death</hi> hath ſtared thee in the face, with its gaſtly <hi>viſage:</hi> how have thy knees ſmote againſt each other, like <hi>Belſhazers!</hi> Thy Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:107489:60"/> wax'd pale, and trembling ſeized thy joynts; and anguiſh and horror ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized thy Conſcience. Like <hi>Cain;</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending that <hi>Every thing that met thee would kill thee;</hi> and what killed, would damn thee. Yet after all this, thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneſt to thy old ſecurity, yea like heated water thou becomeſt more cold, or ſoftned Iron, more hard than e're be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>Ninteenthly, If there be any ſpark of <hi>Ingenuity</hi> left in thee, let's try to blow up that. Chriſt went not thus <hi>lingringly</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the work He undertook for thy ſake. But he left the Manſions of Glory, and came down from Heaven, more willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than thou canſt be perſuaded to go thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Lo I come to do thy will O my God. In the volume of thy look it is written of me. He came leaping over the hills, skipping over the mountains.</hi> Conquering all difficulties in the way. <hi>With deſire he deſired to eat that Paſſover</hi> he knew was to be his laſt, and himſelf immediately to ſucceed it. <hi>I have a Baptiſm to be Baptized with, and how am I ſtraitned till it be accompliſhed?</hi> And when his hour was come he <hi>delays</hi> not one hour longer, but went to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> where he was to dye. When they ſought to take him, he called the <hi>Traytor</hi> friend, which
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:107489:61"/> kiſt him into their hands, yea offered himſelf to them of his own accord, <hi>whom ſeek ye! I am he,</hi> and when that word had ſtruck them down, he let them riſe, and bind, and carry him away, tho <hi>he had more than twelve legions of Angels</hi> ready for his Reſcue. 'Twere endleſs to reckon up thoſe many Arguments you meet with in Hiſtory, to ſhew how readily he went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that dreadful work, and how active he was in his Bloody <hi>Paſſion.</hi> Read, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, Conſider theſe things well: and for ſhame make more haſt to be ready to attain that bleſſedneſs with him: for the procuring which, he was ſo ready to be made a <hi>curſe</hi> for thee.</p>
            <p>Twentiethly, This thy <hi>delay</hi> wounds God in his tendereſt part, his Eye, his Heart, his Bowels. A wound is trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome where ere 'tis fixt, but neither ſo painful nor ſo mortal in an Arm or Leg, as in ſome vital part. To wound God in the Foot of his Providence, the Arm of his Power, or Hand of his Juſtice, is a provocation, but not like wounding him in the Eye of his Pitty, Heart of his Grace and Mercy, and the Bowels of his tender Compaſſions. All the moſt amiable and endearing <hi>Attributes</hi> of God, ſhine moſt reſplendently in this work of God; to
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:107489:61"/> give his Son for ſinners: and for ſinners to refuſe this Gift, deſpiſe this Love, make light of it, as not worth receiving, or preparing to receive it, what can be more provoking?</p>
            <p>But ſet aſide at preſent, the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the reſt, and think what the abuſe of his patience alone amounts to: <hi>Rev.</hi> ii. 21. <hi>I gave her ſpace to repent and ſhe repented not:</hi> was the moſt killing <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle</hi> in Chriſts charge againſt <hi>Jeſabel. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſeſt thou the riches of his goodneſs, and forbearance, and long ſuffering: not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the goodneſs of God leads thee to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> Rom. ii. 4. This is the ſin by which men <hi>Treaſure up wrath againſt the day of wrath.</hi> For as Gods long ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhould be Salvation to us, the abuſe of it becomes the ſureſt, and the ſoreſt Damnation. <hi>Laeſa patientia fit furor,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed patience turns into fury. And <hi>God ſwears</hi> in his wrath at laſt, <hi>They ſhall never enter into his reſt,</hi> who had grieved him, by refuſing the tenders of it, forty years together.</p>

            <p>Laſtly, This tempting to <hi>Delay,</hi> is the <hi>Divels</hi> laſt and worſt <hi>ſtratagem</hi> againſt thy ſoul. 'Tis true, he will if he can, keep thee in ignorance, ſenſuality, prophaneſs, formality without once ſuffering thee to

But if thou get out of this <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon,</hi> and begin to ſee the light, and by ſome ſtartling Providence, or rouſing Sermon, beeſt put in mind of theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and ſo reſolveſt to look better to them, and to turn to God, and <hi>prepare</hi> in earneſt for death, and for the coming of Chriſt, becauſe thou ſeeſt the indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible neceſſity of all this.</p>
            <p>Then will <hi>Satan</hi> diſguiſe himſelf into an <hi>Angel of Light,</hi> and not only allow, but applaud all thoſe thy purpoſes: that he may be leſs ſuſpected as the Author of the laſt ſuggeſtion, with which, as his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-piece,</hi> he intends to aſſault thee, to thy utter ruin; and therefore hee'l whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to thy heart, to this, or the like purpoſe.

Who would, <hi>who can, dwell with everlaſting burnings?</hi> Thou deſerveſt to be damn'd, and damn'd again, if thou wouldeſt not reſolve to be ſav'd and go to Heaven. But let me mind thee yet of one thing: thou knoweſt 'tis an <hi>old ſaying</hi> and a true: <hi>fair and ſoftly goes
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:107489:64"/> far,</hi> no more haſt than good ſpeed: 'tis all in good time for theſe matters yet: the work is not ſo hard, as ſome would make thee believe; God is merciful, and Chriſt dyed for ſinners, and God hath ſworn he deſires not their death: and ſaid that <hi>At what time ſoever they repent, he will receive them.</hi> And beſides thou art young and ſtrong, and haſt many buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to mind, and men muſt not neglect their Callings, and providing for their Families: and after theſe are done, then mayeſt thou mind <hi>Religion,</hi> with leſs di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction, having ſettled and diſpatcht thy other neceſſary Affairs firſt; and tho thou beeſt pritty old, ſuch and ſuch as thou knoweſt are ten or twenty years older, and pretty luſty ſtill and thou mayeſt live as long as they.</p>
            <p>And ſuppoſe the worſt come that can, that thou ſhouldeſt be taken <hi>ſick:</hi> 'tis time enough, then to repent, and cry God mercy; and thou mayeſt ſend for thy Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to comfort thee, and get good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to Pray for thee, and 'tis but repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that thou mayeſt do then, for <hi>True Repentance,</hi> you have often heard, <hi>is never too late,</hi> and therefore why ſhould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou divert thy ſelf from thy buſineſs, and put thy ſelf into a way thou wilt not

            <p>I would add no more, did not one word remain, which may ſeem fit, to clinch and rivet that Nail, I have been forcing home, with ſo many blows. And I ſhall take it out of your own mouths. Methinks I

            <p>Well, be it ſo, admit it had been deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered at this length, (which yet by the way it was not) let me in cool blood, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate the caſe with theſe <hi>Objectors,</hi> before we part.

Why doſt thou ſtill <hi>delay?</hi> That's enough which doth the work it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to: but that's too little which doth it not. The <hi>Motives</hi> may be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to leave thee inexcuſable, but they are not enow for thee, till they effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally perſuade thee to leave thy ſin, and eſcape thy danger. And for the next, muſt I bear your petulent ſcorn, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring you of returning to God, with ſuch a number, and ſhall it coſt you no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, to forget him days without number?

            <p>Is it ſo tedious to you to hear your ſins Arraigned and Condemned a long hour. And what is it to God to be diſhonoured and provoked by them all thy life long? Is it a load which breaks the back of thy <hi>Patience,</hi> to hear Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives multiplyed, to turn thee <hi>Speedily?</hi> And is it no dangerous tryal of Gods Patience, to load him with thy multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed ſins, as a <hi>Cart is loaden with Sheaves and preſſed down?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it be weariſome to hear thy ſins reproved?

He being the Son of <hi>God,</hi> and our Lord and Maſter, ſaying, <hi>I muſt work,;</hi> 'tis as if a Son in the Family ſhould ſay to the Servants, or a Wealthy fore-handed Man to his poor Neighbours, who have nothing but their Hands to Live on: <hi>What ever you do, I muſt mind my Buſineſs; I muſt labour, and not ſquander away one Day after another; my Father will not ſuffer it in me; and I ſhould quickly be undone by ſuch a Courſe.</hi> Such Words, ſpoken in their own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, are more awakening, more pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, than if they only bid them mind their Buſineſs: For they ſmart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſarcaſtically reproach their <hi>Sloath,</hi> and upbraid them for their Loyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</p>
            <p>For if the Maſter of the Family will not bear it in a Son, much leſs will he in a Servant; and if he that's well before-hand, muſt be induſtrious to prevent Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty and Want; much more muſt he,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:107489:69"/> that hath but from Hand to Mouth.</p>
            <p>But the quickning Influence of the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample</hi> is not all: For, <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon by which it is inforced, ſhews it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to many. For when He had ſaid, <hi>I muſt work,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>while 'tis Day;</hi> when he comes to give the Reaſon of it, he ſaith not, <hi>The Night cometh, when</hi> I can't <hi>work;</hi> but, <hi>When no Man can work;</hi> ('tis St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>'s Note) thereby clearly implying, that the Duty reaches all, whom the Reaſon of the Duty reaches: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to thus much; That every Man who hath Work to do, which muſt be done by Day, and cannot be done by Night, muſt haſten to diſpatch it, while the Day laſts; leſt he be ſurprized and prevented by the Nights Approach.</p>
            <p>Having thus briefly clear'd my Paſſage to what I deſign, by ſhewing, that the Words, tho ſpoken by our <hi>Lord</hi> of Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; yet are fairly Applicable unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and may have Efficacious Influence both upon their Duty, and their Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to engage them to improve their <hi>Opportunities</hi> ſpeedily, for the Work of <hi>God,</hi> and their own Souls; which I could make good by more than Twenty of the beſt <hi>Expoſitors,</hi> both Antient and Modern, if 'twere needful. I ſhall now proceed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:107489:69"/> to graſp the Strength and Scope of the whole <hi>Verſe,</hi> into one full and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive Obſervation, alwayes Uſeful, and to the preſent Occaſion very Seaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</p>
            <p>Take it in theſe plain Words, and eaſie to be underſtood:</p>
            <p>The Conſideration of the Work we have to do, and the Time allowed, and limited, for the Doing of it in, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſably oblige us, to the utmoſt Speed and Diligence, in the Doing of it.</p>
            <p>I conceive, theſe Expreſſions are fairly Commenſurate with the <hi>Text:</hi> And, as they leave out nothing, which is material in it; ſo they add nothing to it, but what is evidently Comprehended in it; as will be farther manifeſt, by explaining theſe Three Particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What is meant by this <hi>Work</hi> we have to do.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What is the <hi>Time</hi> or <hi>Seaſon</hi> allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do it in, call'd in the <hi>Text</hi> a <hi>Day,</hi> or <hi>While it is Day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. What is the <hi>Limitation,</hi> by which this <hi>Time</hi> is bounded, and to which it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained; which is partly imply'd in calling
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:107489:70"/> it a <hi>Day,</hi> which is a definite, and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd Portion of Time, partly expreſs'd in the word <hi>Night,</hi> which puts an End and Period to the <hi>Day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe, as they relate to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> (which I touch, becauſe he firſt applyes them to Himſelf, and ſhall after wholly wave and ſuperſede) were as to his <hi>Work:</hi> To prove Himſelf to be the Son of <hi>God;</hi> the True, the Promiſed <hi>Meſſiah:</hi> To reveal the Will and Counſel of his <hi>Father,</hi> to the World: To ſhew to Men the way of Salvation, and Eternal Life: To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the Covenant of Grace, and Preach the <hi>Goſpel:</hi> And to manifeſt both Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and his Doctrine to be of <hi>God,</hi> by working many, and mighty <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles;</hi> and by ſpeaking, as never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Man ſpake; and doing ſuch <hi>Works,</hi> as never any other Man did; and <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving Himſelf mighty both in Word and Deed, before</hi> God, <hi>and all the People,</hi> Luk. 24.19. till he had confirm'd the Faith of them who believed in Him, and left the Incredulous and Obſtinate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Excuſe: And ſuch was the <hi>Work</hi> of Opening the Eyes of him that was born Blind, Recorded in this <hi>Chapter;</hi> and the Words he ſpake upon that Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:107489:70"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> For His <hi>Day.</hi> It was the Time allotted him of his <hi>Father,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in this World; the Seaſon of his Miniſtry, the Space in which a Reſtraint was laid upon the Powers of Darkneſs, from hindring him to fulfil all that was fore-told concerning him, and to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh all that was needful to be done, for his Father's Glory, and his Peoples Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, before his laſt Suffering.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>Night</hi> was his <hi>Death,</hi> and going out of this World; the <hi>Hour</hi> of the <hi>Wicked,</hi> and the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> to which he was to be ſubject in his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, St. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.53. in which, according to his <hi>Father</hi>'s Determinate Counſel, he did voluntarily ſuſpend his Power of working <hi>Miracles,</hi> and would not deliver Himſelf; but ſuffered Himſelf, firſt to be <hi>Apprehended,</hi> and then <hi>Condemned</hi> to <hi>Dye,</hi> and then by <hi>Wicked Hands to be Crucifyed and Slain,</hi> Act. 2.23.</p>
            <p>I have thus briefly glanc'd at the Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Words,</hi> as they relate to our <hi>Saviour,</hi> to whom they were primarily apply'd; that this may facilitate the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of them, as applicable to our our ſelves; to which I ſhall confine my ſelf, in the Handling and Improving of them: And therefore, the <hi>Work</hi> to be
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:107489:71"/> done, as it concerns us, is to believe in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> This is St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>'s; from <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.28, 29. <hi>What ſhall we do, that we may work the Works of</hi> God? <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> anſwered, and ſaid unto them, <hi>This is the Work of</hi> God, <hi>that ye Believe on Him, whom. He hath ſent.</hi> That is the <hi>Work</hi> He hath enjoyn'd us, according to 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.23. <hi>This is his Commandment, That ye Believe on the Name of his Son</hi> Jeſus Chriſt. Our Work is to Repent ſincerely of our Sins, and turn to <hi>God</hi> with our whole Hearts, and to <hi>bring forth Fruits meet for Repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, upon the <hi>Fourth Penitential Pſalm:</hi> What are theſe <hi>Works</hi> of his <hi>Father,</hi> which he ſayes, <hi>Are to be wrought by Day, and not by Night? Niſi agri intellectualis cultura;</hi> The Tillage and Cultivating of our Souls; which the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Jeremiah</hi>'s Deſcription of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, agrees well with, Jer. 4.3, 4. <hi>Break up your Fallow Ground, and ſow not among Thorns: Circumciſe your ſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord, and take away the Fore-skin of your Hearts:</hi> Kill the Thorns and Weeds of your Luſts and Corruptions, by plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the Roots of them, by the Plough of Godly Sorrow, Mortification, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of Life. This Work is, <hi>To
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:107489:71"/> work out our own Salvation with Fear and Trembling,</hi> Phil. 2.12. In a word, It is to become good Men, good Chriſtians, and to live as becomes thoſe who profeſs to be ſuch; to get our Peace made with Heaven; to be fit to Dye; to Glorify God, and to ſave our own Souls; which is the <hi>One Thing neceſſary,</hi> the Work God hath ſent us into this World for.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Time, the Seaſon, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us to do this Work in, is the <hi>Day</hi> of our Natural Life; as a Good <hi>Expoſitor</hi> upon the Words, <hi>The ſpace of every Mans Life, is his</hi> Day: Therefore, as the Short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Day quickens Work-men to Induſtry and Sedulity, leſt the Darkneſs of the Night ſhould over-take them, in the Midſt of their Endeavours, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Work is finiſhed: So we, knowing the Time of our <hi>Life</hi> is but ſhort, ſhould be aſham'd and afraid to loyter, and freeze in Sloath and Idleneſs; and muſt not <hi>delay</hi> at all, leſt our <hi>Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities</hi> ſlip from us, paſt Recovery. And farther, Our <hi>Day</hi> is the <hi>Day</hi> of Grace, while we have the Sun of Righteouſneſs ſhining in the Light of the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> and while we have God's Ordinances without, and the Motions and Aſſiſtance of his Spirit within, before the Means of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:107489:72"/> be taken from us, or the Bleſſing be taken from the Means: And God's bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Spirit, for our often quenching, grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and reſiſting of Him, and refuſing his proffered Aids, and gracious Help; with-draw, and leave us, and Blackneſs of Darkneſs over-ſhade, yea over-whelm, our Minds; as the Dreadful Beginnings of Eternal Night.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> By Night, which limits our <hi>Day,</hi> is to be underſtood (as may be gathered from the Oppoſition betwixt theſe two) the contrary, to what is meant by <hi>Day.</hi> And therefore it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies our Natural Death, or any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Degree or Tendency toward it. Loſs of our Senſes, Reaſon, or ſuch decayes of them, as make us incapable of Acting as Men, in our great Concerns: Or the ſetting of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> Sun: the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of <hi>God</hi>'s Kingdom and Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick: <hi>God</hi>'s departure from us, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away his Light and Guidance: His Grace and Spirit; without which, we can do nothing but wander, and wilder, and loſe our ſelves and do no Work, but what hath <hi>Death</hi> for its Wages; and find no way, but what leads down to Hell. To Sum up this plain Explication in the eaſieſt Words I can: We are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſably
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:107489:72"/> bound, and it infinitly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us, to make haſt to Believe, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, get our Peace made with <hi>God,</hi> and to be ready to Dye, while <hi>God</hi> ſpares our Lives, and continues the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and the means of Grace amongſt us, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers us his Help, by the frequent moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Spirit. For as this Work may be happily done by <hi>Day;</hi> that is, while theſe Mercies are continued; ſo if they be taken away, and <hi>Night</hi> over take us, before our Work be done, it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible it ever ſhould be done; and we muſt be undone for Ever.</p>
            <p>I now return to the Obſervation, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which I graſpt the ſcope, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Text, which was this. The Conſideration of the Work we have to do; and the Seaſon allowed, and limited for the doing of it in, oblige us indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſably, to utmoſt ſpeed and diligence in the doing of it.</p>
            <p>The Holy Scripture is very copious, and full in preſſing both ſpeed and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, upon the accounts this Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion intimates, it ſhall ſuffice to name a few at preſent for Confirmation, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.6. <hi>Seek ye the Lord while He may be found, Call upon Him while he is near;</hi> which ſuppoſeth, what <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.6. expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:107489:73"/> there is a <hi>Time,</hi> in which there's no coming near Him, <hi>Like</hi> 13.24. <hi>Strive to enter in at the ſtraight Gate: for many, I ſay unto you, will ſeek to enter in, and ſhall not be able: when once the Maſter of the Houſe is riſen, and hath ſhut the Door,</hi> Joh. 12.35. <hi>Yet a little while is the Light with you; walk while ye have the Light, leſt Darkneſs come upon you: for he that walketh in Darkneſs, knoweth not whither he goeth: While ye have Light believe in the Light,</hi> Eccleſ. 9.10. <hi>Whatever thy Hand findeth to do, do it with thy Might: for there is no work, nor device, nor know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, nor wiſdom in the Grave, whither thou goeſt.</hi> And of how much greater conſequence thy Work is, ſo much greater in Reaſon, ſhould be both thy Speed and Diligence.</p>
            <p>I now proceed to the proof of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, and to ſhew the Reaſons, why 'tis ſo neceſſary to be Speedy and Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent about this Work: and becauſe thoſe Reaſons are uſually moſt cogent and force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, which are drawn from the Nature of the thing, which is to be confirmed by them, I will take them all from the <hi>Text</hi> it ſelf, which is like ſome well-ſtor'd Manſion, or noble Seat, which is Furniſh't with all needful Proviſions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in its own Bounds.</p>
            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:107489:73"/>
            <p>And <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe 'tis <hi>Work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe a <hi>Convenient Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> is allowed to do it in.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Becauſe this Seaſon is of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncertain Continuance,</hi> will not laſt always, and may ſlip from us ſuddenly, 'ere we be aware.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> 'Tis <hi>Work:</hi> Work with an <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis;</hi> our main-buſineſs, not our by-buſineſs, though too many make it ſo. The great <hi>Errand,</hi> upon which <hi>God</hi> ſent Us into this World. <hi>Moſes</hi> tells Us, 'tis not a <hi>vain thing; but 'tis our Life,</hi> our Life is lent Us for it; and our Life depends upon it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.47. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of it here, and the Safety of it here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; another manner of Work than heaping up Riches, for that's a <hi>vain thing,</hi> Pſal. 39.6. with <hi>Job</hi> 'tis the only Work of true <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> Job. 28.28. <hi>And unto Man he ſaid; Behold the fear of the Lord that is Wiſdom, and to depart from Evil, is <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding.</hi> A Man, a Wiſe Man, who only deſerves the name of a Man, ſhould count nothing elſe compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively worth his Care.: 'tis <hi>David's <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num petii,</hi> Pſal. 27.4. The one thing he deſired of <hi>God,</hi> to injoy Opportunities
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:107489:74"/> to help him in this Work. 'Tis <hi>Solomons Totum hominis,</hi> the whole of Man's Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Happineſs, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.13. <hi>Let us hear the Concluſion of the whole Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, fear</hi> God <hi>and keep his Commandments; for this is the whole of Man.</hi> 'Tis St. <hi>Paul's</hi> great <hi>Race.</hi> His <hi>hic labor hoc opus,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.24. <hi>So Run that ye may obtain;</hi> ſo Fight (againſt your Spiritual Enemies) as Men that are in earneſt, make not vain Floriſhes, only to beat the Air: So ſtrive, that you may Win and Wear an incorruptible Crown; in a word, from our Lords own Mouth, 'tis <hi>primum quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendum,</hi> Mat. 6.33. <hi>Seek ye firſt the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of</hi> God, <hi>and His Righteouſneſs;</hi> and the <hi>unum neceſſarium,</hi> St. <hi>Luke</hi> 10.42. <hi>But one thing is needful:</hi> Signally, and Eminently the <hi>Work</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which He hath given Us to do, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.29.</p>
            <p>Now this Conſideration, that Religion, the Glorifying <hi>God,</hi> the Saving of our own Souls, is Work, our great Work implyes theſe Five things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. It's neceſſity it muſt be done.</item>
               <item>2ly. It's priority, it muſt not be poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon'd, but firſt done.</item>
               <item>3ly. It's difficulty, it muſt not be tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled in; but done with all our Skill and Might.</item>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:107489:74"/>
               <item>4ly. It's perfection, it muſt not be done by halves.</item>
               <item>5ly. It's certain Reward; all Work ſhall have it's Wages.</item>
            </list>
            <p>All which Mighty Weights, one would think, might ſtir a quick and vigorous Motion, in the moſt ruſty Engine; I mean, the moſt reſtive lazy Soul: if we would hang them on, with due and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Meditation.</p>
            <p>Let Us conſider them a little, one by one.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe 'tis our <hi>Work</hi> it muſt be done, what ever elſe be left undone, or we muſt be undone Eternally, by, and for, neglecting it. Remember the Doom of the <hi>Sloathful Servant,</hi> who neglected to get, what he knew he ſhould have had, and had Opportunity to have provided, St. <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.13. <hi>Bind him Hand and Foot, and Caſt him into utter Darkneſs.</hi> You may Read his Fault in his Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; one is the <hi>Anagram</hi> of the other. He bound his own Hands and Feet with Cords of Sloath and Negligence; and now His Maſter cauſes them to be bound with Chains of Vengeance. He <hi>Slept</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Light vouchſaft him, as if it had been <hi>Night:</hi> and now he ſhall have
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:107489:75"/> Darkneſs to extremity; but ſuch as will never yield him Reſt or Sleep.</p>
            <p>This being our <hi>Work,</hi> it is ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, it muſt not be neglected by any means, upon any pretence whatever; though it were to give outward Attendance on <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, as he told <hi>Martha</hi> plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, preferring <hi>Maries</hi> ſitting at His Feet, to hear His Word, and minding this one <hi>needful thing,</hi> before all <hi>Martha's</hi> trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom Diligence; in which, ſhe was Cumbred with much Serving, to make Proviſion for Him; 'tis more <hi>neceſſary</hi> then to Eat; therefore, <hi>Job</hi> eſteemed <hi>God</hi>'s Words, more, not only than his <hi>Dainty,</hi> but his Dayly, his <hi>Neceſſary Food,</hi> Job. 23.12. St. <hi>Paul,</hi> but to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote this <hi>Work</hi> in others, ſaith, <hi>Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is laid upon me, and Woe be unto me, if I Preach not the Goſpel,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.16. And may not we, ſhould not we all ſay, <hi>Neceſſity</hi> is laid upon us, and Woe be unto us, if we Believe not, if we Obey not the Goſpel?</p>
            <p>'Tis more neceſſary than to Live; Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Men of <hi>God</hi> have willingly ſpent their Lives to help others in this Work. <hi>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther count I my Life dear to me, ſo that I might finiſh my Courſe with Joy, and the Miniſtry which I have Received of the</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:107489:75"/> Lord Jeſus, <hi>to Teſtify the Goſpel of the Grace of</hi> God, Act. 20.24. Yea, our <hi>Lord</hi> himſelf counted this <hi>His Meat and Drink,</hi> and refus'd his bodily Food, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven when He was Hungry, to Feed on this, St. <hi>John</hi> 4.32, 34. Yea, He eſteem'd it ſo <hi>neceſſary,</hi> that He came down from Heaven, endured the <hi>Croſs;</hi> and Bore the Law's <hi>Curſe,</hi> and his Father's <hi>Wrath,</hi> to Accompliſh it.</p>
            <p>In a word, The End is more <hi>neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> than all the Means conducing to it; and next to <hi>God's</hi> Glory, our own Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is the ultimate End of all we have, or are, or do; and therefore, more <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary</hi> than them, all put together. When ſome told good Dr. <hi>Reignolds,</hi> He would Kill himſelf with Studying and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, advis'd him to ſpare himſelf; He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, <hi>Nec propter vitam vivendi perdere cauſam:</hi> He would not to ſave Life, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect that, for which God gave him Life; and for which alone, it is worth while to Live. <hi>Good Lord!</hi> That Men can find time for every thing elſe, and account the moſt trivial Matters worthy of their Care; and can find neither, for this great, this neceſſary Work.</p>
            <p>'Twas a ſmart <hi>Sarcaſm,</hi> which the Great <hi>Auguſtus</hi> caſt upon the <hi>Gauliſh La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes;</hi>

                  </gap>fficillima, ars faecilitatis,</hi> The <hi>Art</hi> of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Happy,</hi> is of all the Hardeſt, becauſe of all the moſt Excellent. <hi>The Righteous are hardly ſaved,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.18. The Way to Hell is broad and ſmooth, of eaſie Deſcent: But the Way to Heaven is ſtrait and rug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and muſt be climb'd with Labour. I ſay not this to fright you out on't, but to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:107489:77"/> provoke your Diligence. 'Tis a <hi>Greek</hi> Proverb, <hi>The Gods give Nothing, but ſell All that's Good.</hi> The Price they ſell it for, is <hi>Labour.</hi> When a <hi>Leader</hi> tells his Souldiers, before a Storm or Battle, how Valiant and Stout their Enemies are, and what Men of Mettle they muſt grapple with; 'tis not to daunt them, or give them an Excuſe to turn their backs, and run away; but to inflame their Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and whet their Valour. So when the <hi>Scripture</hi> tells us, <hi>Our Adverſary the Devil, is a Roaring Lyon;</hi> 'tis not to ſcare us, but make us watchful, and to provoke us to Reſiſt him Manfully. And when it tells us, <hi>We wreſtle not with (weak) Fleſh and Blood, but Principalities and Powers,</hi> Eph. 6. 'tis to mind us to gird on our <hi>Armour,</hi> and beſtir our ſelves with becoming Boldneſs, and ſtand our Ground with Reſolution: The things <hi>Religion</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd to, and the Emblems of a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> ſpeak it to be hard: A Fighting <hi>Souldier;</hi> a Contending <hi>Racer;</hi> a Wreſtling <hi>Combatant;</hi> a Laborious <hi>Husbandman;</hi> a Trading, Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling <hi>Merchant.</hi> Many Corruptions muſt be mortify'd; Right Eyes pluck't out, Right Hands cut off.

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:107489:78"/> muſt be learnt, and practis'd. And, Who can reckon all this Eaſy, and like to coſt no <hi>Pains,</hi> but he that never tryed, never conſidered what 'tis to be a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian indeed?</hi> Therefore, flatter not your ſelves, that you can attain it, how and when you pleaſe: But learn this Diſcipline betimes, <hi>Exerciſe your ſelves to Godlyneſs</hi> continually, ſtand upon your Guard, take to your ſelves the <hi>Whole Armour of God:</hi> But above all, betake thy ſelf to <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Protection, and <hi>God</hi>'s Aſſiſtance: That when thou art weak in thy ſelf, thou may'ſt be ſtrong in Him; that thou may'ſt <hi>Do all Things through Chriſt that ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens thee,</hi> tho thou could'ſt do nothing in thy ſelf: That thou may'ſt be <hi>Strong in the Lord, and the Power of his Might:</hi> Yea, may'ſt be <hi>more than Conqueror, through Him that loved thee;</hi> and bids thee, <hi>Be of good Chear,</hi> becauſe <hi>He hath over-come for thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Becauſe 'tis <hi>Work,</hi> it muſt be carryed on unto Perfection: It muſt not be begun only, and continued in a little, but finiſh't; or elſe as good ne'r a whit, as ne'r the better: As in a <hi>Race,</hi> you muſt run to the End of it, and come timely to the <hi>Goal;</hi> or you had as good not <hi>ſtart,</hi> at the giving of the Signe.</p>
            <p>You know the reproach and loſs that

               <hi>Builder</hi> incurr'd, in the <hi>Goſpel-Parable,</hi> who began to Build, but was not care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to Finiſh; and the <hi>Galations,</hi> though they <hi>ran</hi> well for ſome time; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they gave over, and made an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable halt, are called Fools, and compared to Men bewitch't, for ſtopping in ſo good a Courſe. <hi>He that puts his Hand to the Plough, muſt not look back.

When the Righteous Man turns away from his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and committeth Iniquity, and doth according to all the Abominations that the Wicked Man doth; Shall he Live? All his Righteouſneſs which he hath done, ſhall not be mentioned: In his Treſpaſs that he hath treſpaſſed, and in his Sin that he hath ſinned, in them ſhall he Dye,</hi> Ezek. 18.24. He that's but <hi>half</hi> a Chriſtian, ſhall be <hi>wholly</hi> Damn'd.</p>
            <p>'Tis the <hi>End,</hi> which Crowns the Work. Rev. 3.11. <hi>Behold I come quickly; hold faſt that thou haſt, that no Man take thy
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:107489:79"/> Crown,</hi> and 2.10. <hi>Be thou Faithful to the Death, and I will give thee a Crown of Life; if the Salt loſe its Savour, it is fit for nothing but the Dunghil.</hi> Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life is promiſed to them, <hi>Who by patient continuance in well doing, ſeek for Glory,</hi> Rom. 2.7. Let us therefore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to <hi>Perfect Holineſs in the Fear of</hi> God, 2 Cor. 7.1. Remembring what <hi>Chriſt</hi> Wrote to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Sardis,</hi> who had a <hi>Name</hi> to Live, and was <hi>Dead,</hi> Rev. 3.2. <hi>Be watchful, and ſtrengthen the things which remain, that are ready to dye: for I have not found thy Works perfect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> God.

            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Becauſe 'tis a <hi>Work,</hi> it ſhall be Rewarded. This I add, that you may not want incouragement, amidſt ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny difficulties.

Every Work ſhall have its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:107489:79"/> Recompence. The ſame <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> which gives us this Rule, <hi>He that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to</hi> God, <hi>muſt believe, that HE IS, and that He is a Rewarder of them that diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeek Him,</hi> Heb. 11.6. gives us the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Moſes</hi> having <hi>Reſpect to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of the Reward,</hi> Verſ. 26. Every <hi>Work</hi> ſhall have its <hi>Wages:</hi> If we do our <hi>Own Work,</hi> we muſt be our <hi>Own Pay-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters;</hi> and, if the <hi>Devil</hi>'s, we muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect no better than he uſeth to give. But if we be Speedy, Faithful, Diligent, in this Work of God, we may expect, and ſhall not be diſappointed, of God's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; yea, that He Himſelf will be our <hi>Exceeding great Reward,</hi> as He promiſed the Father of the Faithful, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.1. and will perform to all his Children. <hi>Let us</hi> therefore, <hi>not be weary in Well-doing; for in due time we ſhall Reap, if we faint not,</hi> Gal. 6.9. Wherefore, <hi>Whatſoever you do, do it heartily, as to the</hi> Lord; <hi>knowing that of the</hi> Lord, <hi>you ſhall receive the Reward of the Inheritance: for ye ſerve the Lord</hi> Chriſt, Col. 3.24. <hi>who is not <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteous, to forget your Labour of Love,</hi> Heb. 6.10. If this were not a Work appointed, and enjoyned of God, all our <hi>Recompence</hi> might be, <hi>Who hath required theſe Things at your Hands?</hi> But ſeeing it is the <hi>Work</hi> of God,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:107489:80"/> we ſo run, not as uncertain, that is, not as uncertain of Aſſiſtance; for He will help us to do His own Work: nor of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance; for He cannot but be pleaſed to ſee His own Work carryed on: nor of a Gracious Reward; for <hi>He is Faithful, who hath promiſed; and the Promiſe of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life, is made by that</hi> God <hi>who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Lye,</hi> Tit. 1.2.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore, my Beloved, be ye Stedfaſt and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nmoveable, alwayes abounding in the Work of the</hi> Lord; <hi>foraſmuch as you know, that your Labour is not in vain in the</hi> Lord, 1 Cor. 15.58.</p>
            <p>And <hi>This</hi> may ſuffice to provoke our Speed and Diligence, from the Firſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, <hi>That 'tis Work;</hi> implying its Neceſſity, its Precedency, its Difficulty, its required Perfection, and its ſure Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
            <p>I proceed to the <hi>Second Reaſon, While it is Day;</hi> that is, becauſe a fit Seaſon and Opportunity is vouchſafed and allowed us, to do this Work in. <hi>A Day:</hi> That is the Time of this preſent Life, and the Enjoyment of the Means of Grace, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly in the Goſpel, and inwardly by the Aſſiſtance of His Spirit. And let us conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this as a Day;

               <hi>Firſt,</hi> For <hi>Quality:</hi> God <hi>called the Light, DAY,</hi> Gen. 1.5. The Day is, <hi>Tempus Lucis,</hi> the Time of Light; affording us ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Help, to ſee to do our Work. Therefore, the <hi>Day</hi> is appointed for La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, becauſe 'tis a fit time for it; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.22, 23. <hi>The Sun ariſeth: Man go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth unto his Work, unto his Labour, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the Evening. If any Man walk in the Day, he ſtumbleth not, becauſe he ſeeth the Light of this World: But if a Man walk in the Night, he ſtumbleth, becauſe there is no Light in him,</hi> St. <hi>John</hi> 11.9, 10.</p>
            <p>The Time of this Life, is called <hi>Light,</hi> in Oppoſition to <hi>Death,</hi> which is a State of Darkneſs; and the Grave, which is the Houſe of Darkneſs; the <hi>Land of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> deſcribes it, <hi>ch.</hi> 10.21, 22. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I go, whence I ſhall not Return, even to the Land of Darkneſs, and the Shadow of Death: A Land of Darkneſs, as Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs it ſelf, and of the Shadow of Death, without any Order; and where the Light is as Darkneſs.</hi> And Chap. 18.18. <hi>He ſhall be driven from Light into Darkneſs, and chaſed out of the World.</hi> Once more,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:107489:81"/> Chap. 33.28, 30. <hi>He will deliver his Soul from going into the Pit, and his Life ſhall ſee the Light:</hi> To bring back his Soul from the Pit, to be enlightned with the Light of the Living.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>Seaſon</hi> of Grace is call'd a <hi>Day,</hi> from the <hi>Similitude</hi> of the Fitneſs of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Day, for the Works of this World; and of the Day of Grace, for the Works of the World to come: and from the Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Cauſes, of either of them. The Riſing of the <hi>Sun,</hi> and its Preſence, makes Day; and nothing but the <hi>Sun</hi> can make it: not the <hi>Moon,</hi> or <hi>Stars,</hi> in their greateſt Brightneſs. So the <hi>Son of Righteouſneſs,</hi> as <hi>Chriſt</hi> is called, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.2. ariſing and ſhining, in the Beams of the Goſpel, can only make this <hi>Spiritual Day.</hi> 'Tis not the Twy-light of Nature, nor the Glow-Worm-light of Arts, and Humane Learning; nor the <hi>Moon</hi>-light of the Law; but the <hi>Sun</hi>-light of the Goſpel, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth it. <hi>Chriſt is the true Light,</hi> Joh. 1.9. And in the next <hi>Verſe</hi> after the <hi>Text,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>I am the Light of the World.</hi> See alſo St. <hi>John</hi> 8.12. And in Old <hi>Simeon</hi>'s <hi>Song,</hi> St. <hi>Luke</hi> 2.32. <hi>A Light to lighten the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>and the Glory of thy People</hi> Iſrael.</p>
            <pb n="29" facs="tcp:107489:81"/>
            <p>And therefore, before <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Coming, the World was over-whelmed with Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: But, as the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> had long before fore-told, upon His Appearing, <hi>The People which ſat in Darkneſs, and the Shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Death, ſaw great Light ſpring up,</hi> Matth. 4.16.</p>
            <p>Therefore <hi>Zachary</hi> ſung at the the Birth of his Son St. <hi>John Baptiſt; Thou Child ſhalt be called the Prophet of the Higheſt: For thou ſhalt go before the Face of the</hi> Lord, <hi>to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare His Wayes; to give Knowledge of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation unto His People, by the Remiſſion of their Sins, through the tender Mercies of our</hi> God, (which Words are an Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Deſcription of the Goſpel) <hi>whereby the Day-ſpring from on High hath viſited us; to give Light to them that ſit in Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and in the Shadow of Death; to guide our Feet into the Way of Peace,</hi> St. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.76, 77, 78, 79.</p>
            <p>Now, the Preſence of the <hi>Day</hi> layes a great Engagement upon us to be work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Solomon</hi> enforceth that Exhortation, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.1, 2. <hi>Remember now thy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour in the Dayes of thy Youth;</hi> by this Argument, <hi>While the Sun, or the Light be not darkened:</hi> While the Vigour of thy Senſes, and thy Reaſon laſt, and thy Life is ſpared to thee. And you may ſee
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:107489:82"/> the ſame Reaſon improved by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> with Reſpect to the Day of Grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.12, 13. <hi>The Night is far ſpent, the Day is at hand: Let us therefore put off the Works of Darkneſs, let us put on the Armour of Light: Let us walk Honestly, as in the Day.</hi> And <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Ye were ſometimes Darkneſs, but now are ye Light in the</hi> Lord: <hi>Walk as Children of Light, and have no Fellowſhip with the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Works of Darkneſs.</hi> And again: 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.5, 6, 7, 8. <hi>Ye are all Children of the Light, and of the Day: We are not of the Night, nor of the Darkneſs. Therefore, let us not ſleep, as do others; but let us watch, and be ſober: For they that ſleep, ſleep in the Night; and they that are drunken, are drunken in the Night. But let us who are of the Day, be ſober, putting on the Breſt-plate of Faith and Love; and for an Helmet, the Hope of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If a Man have Haſte of Buſineſs, he'll Wake and Riſe before the <hi>Sun,</hi> as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> Pſal. 119.147, 148. <hi>I prevented the Dawning of the Morning, and cryed; Mine Eyes prevent the Night-Watches: At Mid-night will I Riſe;</hi> or eke out the Day by Candle-Light.

Rom. 10.21. <hi>All</hi> day <hi>long have I ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out my Hands to a diſobedient, and gain-ſaying People.</hi> St. <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.6. <hi>Why ſtand ye here all the</hi> day <hi>Idle.</hi> It heightned God's Wrath againſt <hi>Jezabel,</hi> that <hi>He gave her ſpace to Repent of her Fornication, and ſhe Repented not,</hi> Rev. 2.21. <hi>The</hi> Lord <hi>is long-ſuffering to us-ward, not willing that any ſhould periſh; but that all ſhould come to Repentance,</hi> 2. Pet. 3.9. And we ſhould <hi>Account this Long-ſuffering, Salvation,</hi> a great Opportunity to promote our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And this Goodneſs, Forbearance, and Long-ſuffering of God, ſhould not be deſpiſed, nor ſecurely trifled away; but ſhould lead us to Repentance (<hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4.) ſpeedily and quickly: And the rather, becauſe, though <hi>God waits to be gracious,</hi> He will not wait alwayes; and though He ſtrive long, and knock often, He will ceaſe both to ſtrive and knock, when He finds it is in vain: And though He allow you a <hi>whole day;</hi> yet, by way of <hi>Limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> 'Tis but a <hi>day;</hi> and that word carryes its <hi>Limits</hi> with it. A <hi>day</hi> is <hi>Pars Temporis menſurata,</hi> a meaſured ſtated Portion of Time. <hi>Are there not Twelve Hours in a day?</hi> Joh. 11.9. He ſaith not
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:107489:83"/> a Month, a Year, an Age; leſt we ſhould be encouraged and emboldned to Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: But a <hi>Day.</hi> And He often puts us in mind of this: Heb. 3.13. <hi>Exhort one another dayly, while it is called to</hi> Day. Verſ. 15. <hi>Whilſt it is ſaid to</hi> Day, <hi>if ye will hear His Voice, harden not your Hearts.</hi> And more expreſly, Chap. 4.7. <hi>Again, He limiteth a certain Day, ſaying in</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid; <hi>To day, after ſo long a Time as it is ſaid to</hi> Day, <hi>if ye will hear His Voice, harden not your Hearts.</hi> Call'd the <hi>Day</hi> of this or that Man. <hi>Oh, that thou hadſt known, at leaſt, in this thy Day, the Things which belong unto thy Peace,</hi> Luk. 19.42. And the Day of Viſitation, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 44. and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.12. And this Day may be ſhortned: There are <hi>Winter-dayes,</hi> and <hi>Dies dimidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ati,</hi> Dayes cut off in the midſt, when the <hi>Sun</hi> goes down at Noon-day, as is threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <hi>Amos</hi> 8.9. And we find moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Inſtances of it, in them who Live not out half their Dayes, as is threatned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>ſome,</hi> and fulfilled upon <hi>many;</hi> who are cut ſhort, in the Noon, in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in the Dawn of their Dayes. There are ſhort Graves good ſtore in every <hi>Church-Yard:</hi> And the <hi>Arabian</hi> Proverb ſaith, <hi>The Old</hi> Camel <hi>carries the Young</hi> Camel's <hi>Skin to the Market.</hi>

            <p>Nay, 'tis abbreviated, and ſhrunk up into a Moment, a <hi>punctum Temporis.</hi> Now, <hi>Now is the Accepted Time, now is the Day of Salvation,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.2.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>Second Reaſon, A Day to Work in, and but a Day;</hi> therefore, be ſpeedy and diligent, leſt you be preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, leſt you be ſurprized and benight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>Night cometh, wherein no Man can Work:</hi> That is Death, at the fartheſt; which will cut us off from all Opportunities, and Poſſibilities, of farther working; and diſpoſeth of every Man, according to the State in which it finds him: as is figuratively expreſs'd by that of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Eccleſ. 11.3. <hi>If the Tree fall toward the</hi> South, <hi>or toward the</hi> North; <hi>in the Place where the Tree falleth, there it ſhall be.</hi> As the Man is fit to go to <hi>Heaven,</hi> or to <hi>Hell,</hi> when he Dyeth; ſo he muſt continue unalterably for ever. Or,</p>
            <p n="2">2. This <hi>[Night]</hi> may ſignify the Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſs,</hi> the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of the Goſpel, the Taking away <hi>God</hi>'s Kingdom, or Candleſtick, out of its place; and leaving us in a diſmal <hi>Night</hi> of Ignorance, Error, Idolatry, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of that true Light, which alone can
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:107489:84"/> 
               <hi>guide our Feet into the Way of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Or,</p>
            <p n="3">3.

And though God neither take us out of the World, nor take away the Means of Grace from the Places we live in: Yet, if <hi>he</hi> take <hi>his</hi> Spirit, <hi>his</hi> Bleſſing, <hi>his</hi> Grace away from the Means, it will be a <hi>Woeful Night</hi> indeed: For He ſaith, <hi>Woe be unto them, when I depart from them,</hi> Hoſ. 9.12. We can neither have Heart to work, nor Succeſs in working in ſo dark a <hi>Night.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this Conſideration, That <hi>Night</hi> haſtens to over-take us, ſhould quicken us to work, becauſe <hi>Night</hi> is

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:107489:85"/> and of his Work, to</hi> God, Rom. 14.12. And <hi>Night</hi> is the time, when we ſhall be call'd to that Account. Your Servants have the <hi>Day</hi> to do your Work, and at <hi>Night</hi> you take an Account of them, how they have done your Work in the <hi>Day.</hi> St. <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.8. <hi>When Even was come, the Lord of the Vineyard ſaith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Steward, Call the Labourers, and give them their Hire.</hi> Our <hi>Lord</hi> will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly come, and take an Account of His Servants, for His Talents committed to them: Matth. 25.19. <hi>After a long time, the Lord of thoſe Servants cometh, and Reckoneth with them:</hi> And then, Woe be to the Sloathful Servant: Verſ. 25,— 30. <hi>Caſt ye the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nprofitable Servant into utter Darkneſs.</hi> He ſhall have <hi>Night</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, even the Horror of Eternal <hi>Night;</hi> who had turn'd his <hi>Day</hi> of Working, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a <hi>Night</hi> of lazy Sleeping.

               <hi>Secondly, Night</hi> is <hi>Reſting Time.</hi> The <hi>Day</hi> is for Labour, the <hi>Night</hi> for Reſt. <hi>Man goeth forth unto his Work, unto his

            <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> may ceaſe their <hi>Labour,</hi> and have no further Toyl in VVorking: The <hi>Latter</hi> muſt ceaſe, and have no further Opportunity, to Finiſh their VVork.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, Night</hi> is <hi>Reſting Time in Mercy</hi> to them, who have Laboured faithfully in the <hi>Day:</hi> They ſhall not be alwayes toyling, and wearying, and wearying out themſelves with hard Labour: But when <hi>Night</hi> comes, <hi>They ſhall reſt from their Labours, and their Works ſhall follow them,</hi> Rev. 14.13. <hi>There remaineth a Reſt for the People of</hi> God, Heb. 4.9. After an hot and ſcorching Day, there ſhall come a cool refreſhing Evening. They that have born the Heat and Burden of the Day, <hi>Shall have a Time of Refreſhing come from the Preſence of the</hi> Lord, when He ſhall ſend <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Act. 3.19, 20. And <hi>They ſhall reſt in their Beds, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Peace,</hi> who have walked in their Uprightneſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.2. As God <hi>will not ſuffer them to be Tempted above their Strength;</hi> ſo not to be wrought beyond it.</p>
            <pb n="38" facs="tcp:107489:86"/>
            <p>Hold out therefore, Chriſtians, faint not; <hi>Yet a little while, and He that ſhall come, will come, and will not tarry. Let him that is Righteous, be Righteous ſtill; and let him that is Holy, be Holy ſtill.</hi> And mark the Incouragement <hi>Chriſt</hi> backs this Exhortation with: <hi>Behold, I come quickly; and my Reward is with me, to give to every Man as his Works ſhall be,</hi> Rev. 22.12. And to put it out of doubt, he adds, <hi>Surely, I come quickly:</hi> As if He ſhould ſay, <hi>'Tis but a little while, a little longer, and your Trouble is over, your Work is done for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chriſt</hi> takes notice of all your <hi>Labours</hi> in his Service, and all your Perſecutions, and Reproaches, and Slanders, with which proud, formal, or prophane Men, will load and oppreſs you; if you be ſincere and faithful to Him: And He will ere long ſet you out of their reach, and the <hi>Devil</hi>'s too. 'Tis worth obſerving, that all the <hi>Epiſtles</hi> to the <hi>Seven Churches</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin thus; <hi>I know thy Works,</hi> Rev. 2.2, 9, 13, 19. 3. 1, 8, 15. And ſuch Additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons follow: <hi>Thy Labour, thy Patience, thy Tribulation, thy Dwelling where</hi> Satan's <hi>Seat is; thy Service, thy Faith, thy Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi> And bids them <hi>Hold faſt, and be Faithful to the Death, and He will give
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:107489:86"/> them a Crown of Life;</hi> and tells them, <hi>He will come quickly.</hi> Is <hi>Iſrael</hi> oppreſſed, and ſhall not <hi>God</hi> take Notice of it? See Exod. 3.7. <hi>I have ſurely ſeen the Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my People, and have heard their Cry, by reaſon of their Task-Maſters; for I know their Sorrows.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall not be alwayes in the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Furnace, nor in the Howling Wilderneſs; but He hath a <hi>Canaan</hi> for them, a Promiſed Land on the other ſide of <hi>Jordan,</hi> of Death. When the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are toyling by reaſon of contrary Winds, and the Ship is toſſed, (Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Temptations are full in their Faces, as they ſail Heaven-ward) <hi>Chriſt</hi> will come to them, and they ſhall have a Calm; and the Ship will be preſently at the Land, whither it was going: <hi>For the Oppreſſion of the Poor, for the Sighing of the Needy, I will now</hi> (now preſently) <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, ſaith the Lord; I will ſet him in Safety, from him that puffeth at him,</hi> Pſal. 12.5. You heard before, that Work im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes Difficulty: It cannot he denyed, but there is ſome Hardneſs in the Work of <hi>Religion:</hi> 'Tis call'd <hi>Labour of Love.</hi> There is Labour, though Love ſweeten it, and eaſe it. <hi>The Fleſh is weak, even where the Spirit is willing.</hi> Our Life of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:107489:87"/> is a Warfare; and ſuch as admits neither Peace nor Truce; but conſtant, either Watching or Fighting, againſt moſt dangerous Enemies; being ſo ſubtle, ſo malicious, ſo powerful, ſo reſtleſs. And <hi>God</hi> will not hold us alwayes to ſuch hard Service: But the Time is haſtning, when He will ſay, Thy Warfare is accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and as He ſaith, <hi>He will not contend for ever; for the Spirit would fail, and the Souls which he hath made,</hi> Iſa. 57.16. ſo He will put a Period to all their <hi>labours, ſorrows,</hi> and <hi>wreſtlings;</hi> at fartheſt, Death will bring thee thy <hi>Quietus,</hi> a Writ of Eaſe; and when Night comes, (and it haſtens apace) thou may'ſt lay thee down in Peace, and take thy Reſt; for thy <hi>God</hi> hath made thy Bed for thee; and He will make thee dwell in Everlaſting Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſt not away therefore your Confidence, which hath great Recompence of Reward; for ye have need of Patience, that after ye have done the Will of</hi> God, <hi>ye might receive the Promiſe: For yet a little while, and He that ſhall come, will come, and will not tarry.</hi> Heb, 10.35, 36, 37. And when He comes, He will not come empty-handed: And <hi>Be not weary in well-doing; for in due time ye ſhall Reap, if ye faint
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:107489:87"/> not.</hi> And as <hi>Joſ ph</hi> ſaid after his Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>God hath made me forget all my Toyl, and my Father's Houſe,</hi> Gen. 41.51. ſo when the approaching <hi>Night</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertakes thee, and thou ſhalt be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s <hi>Boſom,</hi> and <hi>Sleep in Jeſus;</hi> not ſo much as a frightful Dream ſhall interrupt thy Repoſe, or diſturb the Satisfaction of thy everlaſting Reſt. Let the Fore-ſight and Belief of this, quicken thy Induſtry, while the Day continues. And remember that of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Eccleſ. 5.12. <hi>The Sleep of a Labouring Man is ſweet.</hi> If thou haſt done, if thou haſt lov'd the Work of <hi>God</hi> in the Day; He will not only give thee the Sleep of his Beloved at Night; but the harder thou haſt wrought, and the more thou haſt been wearyed at it, the more welcome, the ſounder, and the ſweeter will thy Reſt be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, Night</hi> is <hi>Reſting Time</hi> (that is, a <hi>Time</hi> when they ſhall have no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Opportunity to finiſh their Work) <hi>in Juſtice to the Loyterers. Then Time ſhall be no more,</hi> Rev. 10.6.</p>
            <p>Now, that <hi>Night</hi> above deſcribed; of Death, of the Setting of the Goſpel-<hi>Sun,</hi> or <hi>God</hi>'s Departure from a Soul, (for
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:107489:88"/> what follows will reſpect ſometimes one, ſometimes another of them) will put a Period to their Working, upon a ſeven-fold Account.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> By reaſon of its Darkneſs, in which they cannot ſee to work. <hi>He call'd the Darkneſs, Night,</hi> Gen. 1.5. <hi>The</hi> Sun <hi>went down, and it was Dark,</hi> Gen. 15.17. You know this to be ſo by Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, in every Revolution of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Day. Darkneſs is nothing but Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Light; and when Light is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn, Darkneſs muſt needs follow. When the Evening is ſhut in, the Black and Dark Night (as <hi>Solomon</hi> calls it) ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds preſently; ſpreading its ſable Wings over the whole Hemiſphere: So that, Men can neither ſee their Way to guide their Feet, nor their Work to guide their Hands.</p>
            <p>No Phraſes or Expreſſions of Speech, are more common than theſe; <hi>The Way of the Lord, The Path of Life, Walking with God, Coming to Chriſt, Going to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi> and ſuch like implying Motion.</p>
            <p>Now, How can any of theſe be done in the Darkneſs of the Night? How ſhall we keep the Right Path, that is ſo beſet with ſo many By-wayes on every ſide?
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:107489:88"/> By-wayes of Errour on one hand, and By-wayes of Wickedneſs on the other, if we have no Light to guide us? In Reference to this, is that Paſſage of our Saviour: <hi>Walk while ye have Light, leſt Darkneſs come upon you: For he that walketh in Darkneſs, knoweth not whither he goeth,</hi> St. John 12.35. <hi>Becauſe Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs hath blinded his Eyes,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.11.</p>
            <p>And as there is great danger of loſing, and turning out of the Right Way; ſo there is no leſs of ſtumbling and falling in it, if we have not Light to ſhew us the Stumbling-blocks and Snares, the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> and his Inſtruments lay in our way, that we may avoyd them. <hi>If a Man walk in the Night, he ſtumbleth, becauſe there is no Light in him,</hi> Joh. 11.10.</p>
            <p>And we need the Light no leſs to guide our Hands in Working, than our Feet in Walking. Who, but a Fool or Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, would attempt any curious Work in the Dark? To Paint, to Carve, to make a Clock or Watch, or but to write a Letter? Now, the Work we have to do for <hi>God,</hi> and our Souls, beyond all peradventure, requires the cleareſt Light, to ſee to do it well. How can we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, repent, obey, or try theſe Graces by the Law or Goſpel, when we cannot
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:107489:89"/> fee the Rule by which they ſhould be meaſured. While <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Son of Righteouſneſs ſhines in his Ordinances, and by his Spirit, there is a Day; and you may ſee to work the Work <hi>God</hi> ſets you: But when that departs, you are preſently be-nighted, and cannot take one Step, or draw one Line aright. The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Sun only enlightens the <hi>Medium,</hi> &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers the Object; but infuſeth not a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Power into the Eye. It opens not the Eyes, it makes not blind Men ſee: Though it makes things viſible to them that can ſee, yet make Night by ſetting. But this Sun makes Day in an extraordinary manner, it gives Light and Sight both. When St. <hi>Paul</hi> was call'd and ſent to Preach the Goſpel, his Commiſſion ran thus: <hi>I ſend thee to open their Eyes, and to turn them from Darkneſs to Light,</hi> Act. 26.18.</p>
            <p>How diſmal a Night muſt therefore follow, when this Sun is ſet, which leaves Men both Blind, and in the Dark? That Light which diſcovers what our VVorks are, can only direct how they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſuch as they ought to be. John 3.21. <hi>He that doth Truth, cometh to the Light; that his Deeds may be made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that they are wrought in</hi> God. And
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:107489:89"/> it muſt be by that Light, we muſt ſee to do <hi>God</hi>'s Work. Improve it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, while you have it, before the <hi>Night,</hi> the <hi>time</hi> of Darkneſs overtake, yea over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm, you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> No Man can work in this <hi>Night,</hi> becauſe 'tis incapable of any Light. When the Natural Light of this World leaves us, and Night draws the Curtains of Darkneſs round about our Habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the whole Space 'twixt Heaven and Earth, is nothing but Obſcurity, we can relieve our ſelves with the <hi>Artificial</hi> Lights of Candles, Lamps, or Torches: But this <hi>Night</hi> reſiſts ſuch Remedies, and is Incurable. 'Tis groſs Darkneſs, like <hi>Egyptian Darkneſs,</hi> which might be felt, but not removed; too thick for the faint Beams of any Candle to pierce through, diſperſe, or ſcatter. If you loſe, and loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter out your Day, you cannot redeem your Error, or eke out your Working time by the borrowed Light of Art. As in the <hi>New-Jeruſalem there needs no Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,</hi> Rev. 22.5. ſo in the utter Darkneſs, (which ſeizeth on all, without that Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Place of Light) no Candle is allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or would do any Good. <hi>The Candle of the Wicked ſhall be put out,</hi> Prov. 24.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:107489:90"/> 20. 'Tis obſervable, <hi>God</hi> calls His Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters <hi>Lights. Ye are the Light of the World,</hi> Matth. 5.14. John <hi>was a Burning and a Shining Light,</hi> John 5.35. and the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Goſpel-Ordinances a <hi>Candle-ſtick,</hi> Rev. 1.12. But Churches, and Miniſters, and Ordinances, are only for this Life, there is no uſe of them hereafter. Chriſt walks in the midſt of them: and when he with-draws they ſignify nothing. O ye <hi>Loyterers,</hi> think not to make Candle-Light-Work of your Eternal Concernments, when the Sun is down. Here the Candle &amp; the Sun ſhine both together. And when the Sun ſets, the Candle is put out for Ever.</p>
            <p>You know, I ſuppoſe, where the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome prevails, of multiplying <hi>Tapers, Torches, Candles,</hi> about the <hi>Herſes,</hi> and upon the <hi>Tombs,</hi> and <hi>Graves</hi> of the Dead; and ſinging <hi>Maſſes, Dirges, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiems</hi> for them: and there Laſt are juſt as profitable for their Souls, as the Firſt are ſerviceable to their Eyes, when Death hath clos'd them.</p>
            <p>Chriſtians, I beſeech you, as you love your Souls, beware of theſe Cheats, and venture not your <hi>eternal</hi> Eſtates upon ſuch after-Games, and <hi>Work out your own Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, while you live;</hi> and truſt not to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:107489:90"/> their Superſtitious, and Covetous Frauds, who undertake to do it for you when you are Dead.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Men cannot work when <hi>Night</hi> is come, becauſe the <hi>Night</hi> is Unfruitful: If you think to work then, or try to work then, you will moſt certainly but loſe your Labour. I may uſe the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s Expreſſion, at leaſt alluſively, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfruitful Works of Darkneſs,</hi> Eph. 5.11.</p>
            <p>If Men ſhould Plow and Sow by <hi>Night,</hi> and no <hi>Day</hi> follow, no Fruit would come of all their Coſt and Pains. We need the <hi>Sun,</hi> not only to ſee to work by; but alſo to influence our Work: He muſt warm, and cheriſh, and ripen all by <hi>his</hi> Heat, as well as direct the doing of it by <hi>his</hi> Light. When <hi>Night</hi> comes, you cannot work to any Purpoſe or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. Suppoſe you could cry and knock as earneſtly and loud, as did thoſe <hi>Fooliſh Virgins</hi> at Mid-night, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.10. it would prove as uſeleſs to you, as it did to them; or thoſe you read of, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.28. Then (when this <hi>Night</hi> is upon them) <hi>Then they ſhall call upon Me, but I will not anſwer; they ſhall ſeek Me early,</hi> (as they think, perhaps 'tis ſpoken Ironically) <hi>but they ſhall not find Me: But they ſhall eat of the Fruit of their own
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:107489:91"/> way,</hi> (Oh bitter Fruit!) <hi>and be fill'd with their own Devices,</hi> Verſ. 31.</p>
            <p>And as I touch't before the Folly of thoſe, who truſt to the Prayers of others, when they are dead: So let me earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admoniſh and intreat you, not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Praying for your ſelves, 'till you are a Dying. I uſe the word <hi>Praying</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſively, for Penitential Devotion, and being ſincerely Religious. I would not be too ſevere, but I would be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to you; and therefore, I muſt tell you, I think it extreamly dangerous to defer till then. I know you are ready e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to remember the Old Proverb, <hi>True Repentance is never too Late;</hi> But I beſeech you, forget not the Second Part of it, <hi>Late Repentance is ſeldome True.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How often have we ſeen the moſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Penitential Vows of Men, upon their Sick Beds, grow Weak and Dye; as thoſe who made them grow Strong and Lively?</p>
            <p>I would write nothing, but what is moſt ſerious upon ſo weighty a Subject: Yet becauſe many are prone to retain ſuch a Paſſage, who would forget a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Sentence, give me Leave, without Offence or Cenſure, to add the Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:107489:91"/> of thoſe Proverbial Verſes; which ſignify, that the very worſt of Men are ready to pretend Reformation, when they are Sick; though they never intend it, when they are Well: They were fitted to the Times, in which they were made, when the Name of a <hi>Monk</hi> ſignifyed a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Man.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>The Devil was Sick, the Devil a Monk would be:</l>
               <l>The Devil was Well, the Devil a Monk was he.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Truſt not your deceitful Hearts, to ſo deceitful a Time; neither defer your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, till you are ſo unfit to perform it. But while your Strength is firm and your Reaſon ſound, and all your Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in their Vigour, ſet upon this Work, which you'll find hard enough for your beſt Abilities; leſt it prove like Day-Work, attempted in the Night, altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fruitleſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> You cannot work when this Night comes, becauſe it will ſtrip you of your Furniture and Tools, with which you ſhould perform it. When Morning-Light appears, Men Riſe and Dreſs themſelves,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:107489:92"/> and take their Tools, and go forth unto their Work and Labour: But like that Old Man at <hi>Gibeah,</hi> Judg. 19.16. <hi>They come out of the Field from their Work at Even:</hi> and then they ſtrip themſelves, ſet by their Tools, and go to Bed to take their Reſt. While the Day of your Life, and <hi>God</hi>'s Grace are continued, you have Talents to trade with, and Tools to work with; but when Night comes, they muſt be all laid by: Uſe them therefore while you have them.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe a Man had borrowed of his Neighbour ſome uſeful or neceſſary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, for a Work he is much concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to finiſh; or a Schollar a Book, which he is much concerned to Read; but both were lent but for a Day, and muſt be return'd at Night: How hard would One Labour, how cloſely would the Other fit to his Study? Concluding thus: I muſt not Loyter now, for this Work muſt be done; and I cannot do it without this Inſtrument; and this is but lent me till Night, and then 'twill be fetch't away. While the Day laſts, <hi>God</hi> furniſhes you with Tools fitted to your Work: You have Miniſters, you have Bibles, you have Sermons, you have Sacraments, you have all appointed Means of Grace, and you
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:107489:92"/> have Eyes to read, and Ears to hear, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to underſtand, conſider, and judge, Conſciences to check you, Affections to excite and quicken you: But when Night comes all will be taken from you. <hi>Then the Lord will ſay, Take the Talent from him,</hi> Mat. 25.28. And if you do not your work while you are furniſhed with all theſe Helps, What can you hope to do when all are gone?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> No Man can work after this Night is come, becauſe this Work is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd by entring into a Gate or Door; and <hi>Night</hi> is a Time of ſhutting Doors. Joſh. 2 5. <hi>About the Time of Shutting the Gate, when it was Dark.</hi> All the Day the Gates of the Cities ſtand wide open, to afford free Ingreſs and Egreſs to all Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers; and the Doors of your Houſes ſtand open, or but upon the Latch, and yield an eaſy Entrance; but when the Day is ſhut in, you Lock, and Bolt, and Bar, and make all faſt, that none can enter.</p>
            <p>Now, there are <hi>Two</hi> Sorts of Gates, or Doors, which muſt be entred before the <hi>Sun</hi> ſet, and they be ſhut.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Gate, into which Man m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
               </item>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:107489:93"/>
               <item>2. <hi>Man's Door, into which</hi> God <hi>muſt enter.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> God's Gate. <hi>Open to me the Gates of Righteouſneſs.</hi> This is the Lord's Gate, <hi>Into which the Righteous ſhall enter,</hi> Pſal. 118.20. <hi>Enter in at the Streight-Gate,</hi> Matth. 7.13. Now, <hi>God</hi>'s Gate ſtands open all the Day: But at <hi>Night,</hi> the Door is ſhut, as the <hi>Fooliſh Virgins</hi> found to their Shame and Sorrow, St. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.10.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>God</hi> hath <hi>Four Gates,</hi> which ſtand open to Returning Sinners all Day long; but ſhall be all ſhut up at <hi>Night:</hi> The Gates of <hi>Grace,</hi> of <hi>Mercy,</hi> of <hi>Hope,</hi> of <hi>Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Gate of Grace. Grace is <hi>God</hi>'s Free Favour, that Perfection of the Divine <hi>Nature,</hi> which inclines Him to do Good to Men, without any External Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of His own Accord. This Gate ſtands open all the Day. God <hi>waits to be graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and ſtretches out his Hand all the Day long,</hi> to invite, to plead with Sinners, and to beſeech them to accept His Grace and Favour: But if they deſpiſe His Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and will not be perſwaded to come in, <hi>He will caſt off for ever, and be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable no more: He will even forget to be Gracious, and in Anger ſhut up His
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:107489:93"/> tender Mercies.</hi> For ſo I find the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> expreſſing his Fear of this Doom, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.79.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Gate of Mercy. Mercy is that Attribute of <hi>God,</hi> by which His tender Compaſſions are ſtirred up, to pitty His Creatures in their Miſery, and (as it were) to ſympathize with them; to be afflicted in all their Afflictions.</p>
            <p>This Gate ſtands alſo open all the Day; and it even grieves Him to His Heart, to ſee the Miſery Men haſten towards, by their Sin and Folly: And He warns and calls them moſt pathetically; <hi>Turn ye, turn ye; Why will ye Dye?</hi> Ezek. 33.11. And is in a Merciful Conteſt with Himſelf, as you may read <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.8. <hi>How ſhall I give thee up,</hi> Ephraim? <hi>How ſhall I deliver thee,</hi> Iſrael? <hi>How ſhall I make thee as</hi> Admah? <hi>How ſhall I ſet thee as</hi> Zeboim? <hi>My Heart is turned within Me, My Repentings are kindled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether:</hi> And reſolves, that as yet, <hi>He will not execute the Fierceneſs of His Anger;</hi> nor as yet, <hi>Return to Deſtroy them; becauſe He is</hi> God, <hi>and not Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if all His Weeping over them will not make them Mourn, if all His Relen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Compaſſions will not melt them; Their Hardyneſs will harden Him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:107489:94"/> His Softneſs did not ſoften them; and His Mercy will be turn'd into Fury: and in the Spring-Tyde of their Miſery, his Mercy will be in the Loweſt Ebb. And inſtead of weeping any more over them, <hi>He will Laugh at their Calamity, and Mock when their Fear cometh,</hi> Prov. 1.26. And His Mercy will be clean gone for evermore: And though this Gate ſtood open to them till they Dyed; yet He will not ſhew theſe Wonders of Mercy to the Dead; the Dead ſhall not ariſe to have, and praiſe him for them. <hi>His loving Kindneſs ſhall not be declared in the Grave, nor His Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in Deſtruction. His Wonders ſhall not be known in the Dark, nor His Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſions in the Land of Forgetfulneſs,</hi> Pſal. 88.10, 11, 12.</p>
            <p>Oh therefore, follow not after Lying Vanities, to the forſaking of your own Mercies! But while this Gate ſtands open, fly into it, as the Man-ſlayer would into the City of Refuge, before <hi>God</hi> ſhut it up, and ſhut out you (as certainly He will, when <hi>Night</hi> is come) and you be left to the Cruel Mercies of that Aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Blood, that Eternal Miſery, which preſſes after you ſo faſt, ſo cloſe, ſo hard.</p>
            <pb n="55" facs="tcp:107489:94"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>Gate of Hope.</hi> This ſtands open all the Day. While Men live and enjoy the Means of Grace, there remains <hi>Hope,</hi> that they may obtain <hi>God</hi>'s Favour, and eſcape His Wrath. The Common Proverb is true in this Sence, <hi>That while there's Life there's Hope;</hi> as <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lomon</hi> tells us, <hi>To him that is joyned to all the Living, there is Hope,</hi> Eccleſ. 9.4. We meet with this Expreſſion in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.15. <hi>I will give her the Valley of</hi> Achor, <hi>for a Door of Hope:</hi> Which may admit theſe Interpretations amongſt others; Either that the Poſſeſſion of this Valley, being part of the Promis'd Land, was as an Earneſt, and an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to <hi>hope,</hi> they ſhould poſſeſs the Whole: Or, that <hi>Achan</hi> being now ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and the accurſed Thing removed, there was <hi>Hope,</hi> that <hi>God</hi> would again be with them, and drive out their Enemies before them. So the Continuance of Day is a Door of <hi>Hope,</hi> that He who hath given the Means of Grace, will alſo give His Grace, yea, and Glory, at the laſt; and that He who ſpares our Lives after they have been forfeited, may remit the Forfeiture, that we may not Dye eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally.</p>
            <p>And indeed, it is the right Uſe of This, that upholds <hi>God</hi>'s People, in all their
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:107489:95"/> Streights and Fears: In their Affliction and Miſery, while they feed on Gall and Wormwood, they recall to mind, that <hi>God</hi>'s Compaſſions fail not: <hi>And becauſe, through the</hi> Lord's <hi>Mercyes, they are not Conſumed;</hi> therefore have they Hope, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.20, 21, 22. And 'tis the Abuſe of <hi>this,</hi> which holds up Wicked Men againſt the Gripes, the Nippings and Warnings of their own Hearts, thoſe ſecret unſeen Laſhes, and Wounds of their own Conſciences, are ſo frequently inflicting: They know, <hi>God</hi> is Merciful, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> dyed for Sinners; and they <hi>hope,</hi> they may yet Repent, and be Happy, and partake of all this. And this keeps their Hearts from breaking with Horror, and ſuccumbing under a Load, which is truly inſupportable. But when <hi>Night</hi> comes, this Door ſhall be ſhut ſo cloſe, no Beam of <hi>Hope</hi> will dart in, ſo much as at the Key-hole. But all their <hi>Hope</hi> will vaniſh and periſh; and be as the Spider's Webb, and giving up the Ghoſt: Their <hi>Hope</hi> ſhall be cut off for ever, and the dreadful Terrors of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Deſpair ſhall ſeize upon them, and multiply their Sorrows; their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition being as hopeleſs, and helpleſs, in their own Apprehenſions: and Miſery ſhall come upon them in its Perfection,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:107489:95"/> becauſe no <hi>Hope</hi> remains of ever eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping. And this is the moſt invenom'd Sting of the never-dying Worm, and that which makes the Pit of Hell to be, what it is ſo truly called, <hi>Bottomleſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The <hi>Gate of Glory;</hi> That ſtands open too, till <hi>Night:</hi> That is, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, in the higheſt Senſe. The Place, in which <hi>God</hi> moſt fully and openly Communicates Himſelf to Saints and Angels; and beſtows the Complea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Happineſs, the Reaſonable Nature can be capable of; into which, who e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come, ſhall never ſin nor ſorrow more: but be made perfect in Holineſs and Happineſs, by the cleareſt Viſion, and moſt intimate Fruition of <hi>God</hi> Bleſſed for ever. But at <hi>Night,</hi> a Door ſhall be ſhut, to keep all thoſe for ever out, who were not ready to go in with the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom, into the Marriage, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.10.</p>
            <p>In <hi>David</hi>'s Language, <hi>They ſhall never ſee Light, they ſhall never Inhabit</hi> God's <hi>Holy Hill:</hi> In St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, <hi>They ſhall not Inherit the Kingdom of</hi> God: In St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s, <hi>They ſhall have no Entrance admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred into the Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour</hi> Jeſus Chriſt; nor attain the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:107489:96"/> of their Souls. In St. <hi>John</hi>'s, <hi>They ſhall in no wiſe enter into the New</hi>-Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem. In our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s, <hi>They ſhall never ſee the Face of</hi> God <hi>in Heaven;</hi> nor be with Him, to <hi>Behold His Glory;</hi> nor <hi>Follow the Lamb</hi> upon Mount <hi>Zion;</hi> nor <hi>Drink of the Rivers of Pleaſure, which are at</hi> God's <hi>Right Hand:</hi> Nor be fill'd with thoſe Joyes, which are at His Right Hand, for evermore.</p>
            <p>Haſten therefore, while theſe <hi>Gates</hi> are open: And as Men, who are Journeying to a City, where at Even the Bridge is drawn, and the Gates are ſhut, and the Keys are carryed to the Governour, will be ſure to come before that Hour; leſt they be expoſed to the Enemy, or to the Coldneſs and Darkneſs of the <hi>Night,</hi> without either ſafe Shelter, or convenient Lodging: So let theſe Confiderations quicken you, leſt you be be-nighted, and find too ſoon the Folly of your coming too late, to enter into the City of God.</p>
            <p>But Man hath a <hi>Door</hi> too, into which God muſt enter; and this will be ſhut at <hi>Night.</hi> Rev. 3.20. <hi>Behold, I ſtand at the Door, and Knock; if any Man open to Me, I will come in, and Sup with him, and he with Me.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="59" facs="tcp:107489:96"/>
            <p>There is a <hi>Door</hi> of <hi>Knowledge:</hi> The <hi>Key</hi> of <hi>Knowledge</hi> Opens it. When the Eyes of our Underſtandings are enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, opened, to know God in Chriſt; and to receive the Knowledge of His Will. God comes into the Heart through this <hi>Door,</hi> when the Eyes of our Minds are ſo opened, as to know God and Chriſt a right; ſo as to <hi>Know them, is Eternal Life,</hi> Joh. 17.3.</p>
            <p>And a <hi>Door</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> through which Chriſt comes, when He enters to dwell in our Hearts by <hi>Faith, Epheſ.</hi> 3.17.</p>
            <p>And there is a <hi>Door</hi> of <hi>Repentance,</hi> by which Sin is turn'd out, and God is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into our Souls.</p>
            <p>And, <hi>Lastly,</hi> There is the <hi>Door</hi> of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Affections, Love, Deſire, Delight</hi> in God. Theſe are (at leaſt) the Hinges, upon which the <hi>Door</hi> of our <hi>Hearts</hi> turn.</p>
            <p>Now, theſe <hi>Doors</hi> may all be opened to let in God, while the <hi>Day</hi> laſts; and He will come in, and make His Abode with us: John 14.23. Jeſus <hi>ſaid, If any Man love Me, he will keep My Words: And My Father will love him, and We will come unto him, and make Our Abode with him:</hi> But when <hi>Night</hi> comes, they will be ſhut for ever.</p>
            <pb n="60" facs="tcp:107489:97"/>
            <p>Haſten therefore to open them while you may; leſt when you would, it prove too hard for you, and be above both your Skill, and your Power. You know, a <hi>Door</hi> that is opened dayly, opens eaſily: But <hi>Doors,</hi> which ſtand long ſhut, 'tis hard to make them ſtir, or open them, without great Violence, that ſhakes them, and even breaks them in pieces: The Timber will ſwell, the Hinges will ruſt, the Wards of the Lock will be cankered, and the Bolts will even grow into the Staples: And ſo will it, by Proportion, be with your Hearts, if you keep the <hi>Door</hi> long ſhut againſt God. Nay, He may in Anger clap on a <hi>Padlock</hi> on the other ſide, ſhut thee up Judicially in Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, and Impenitency; nail and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racado up the <hi>Door</hi> for ever; becauſe He knock't and call'd ſo long, and woo'd ſo earneſtly in vain. Cant. 5.2. <hi>Open to Me My Siſter, My Love, My Dove, My <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndefiled; for My Head is fill'd with Dew, and My Locks with the Drops of the Night.</hi> Then after many idle Excuſes for her Delay, Verſ. 6. <hi>I opened to my Beloved, but my Beloved had with-drawn Himſelf, and was gone: My Soul failed, when He ſpake. I ſought Him, but I could not find Him; I called Him, but He gave me no Anſwer.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="61" facs="tcp:107489:97"/>
            <p>Take heed, leſt <hi>this</hi> (or worſe) be thy Caſe: Refuſe not to open at the firſt Knock, the firſt Call, the Motions of His Spirit, the Checks of thy Conſcience, the Admonitions of the Word; leſt He Knock no more, or refuſe when thou ſhalt open at thy own Leaſure, to come near the <hi>Door.</hi> The Servants which ſhall be bleſſed, are <hi>They that wait for their Lord; and when he cometh and knocketh, open to him immediately,</hi> Luk. 12.35.</p>
            <p>Rouze up your ſelves therefore, and ſpeak to your Souls in <hi>David</hi>'s Language, and as much as may be with <hi>David</hi>'s Zeal, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24.7, 9. which he witneſſed by the Ingemination of them; <hi>Lift up your Heads, Oh ye Gates; and be ye lift up, ye Everlaſting Doors, and the King of Glory ſhall come in. Who is this King of Glory? The</hi> Lord <hi>of Hoſts, He is this King of Glory.</hi> And take heed that dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Place be not fulfilled upon you; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.10. (the moſt dreadful Word <hi>God</hi> can ſpeak, till <hi>he</hi> ſay, <hi>Depart ye Curſed) Make the Heart of this People fat, and their Ears heavy, and ſhut their Eyes; leſt they be Converted, and I Heal them.</hi> A Place <hi>Six</hi> times repeated in the <hi>New-Teſtament,</hi> to make us mind it; leſt by our ſinful Shutting the <hi>Door,</hi> we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:107489:98"/> God Judicially to ſhut it up for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> No Man can work when this <hi>Night</hi> cometh, becauſe 'tis an abiding <hi>Night:</hi> There is no Day on the other ſide of it. We ſay, <hi>To Morrow is a New Day; what we cannot do to Day, we may do to Morrow:</hi> But there is no Morrow beyond the <hi>Night</hi> of Death. <hi>'Tis ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to all Men once to Dye,</hi> (but once) <hi>and after that the Judgment,</hi> Heb. 9.29. No Second Day of Life allowed to them, who have miſ-ſpent and loſt the Firſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Job</hi> ſaid long ſince: <hi>There is Hope of a Tree, that if it be cut down, it will ſprout again; and that the tender Branch thereof will not ceaſe: Though the Root thereof wax old in the ground, and the Stock thereof Dye; yet through the Scent of Water, it will bud, and bring forth Boughs like a Plant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

As the Waters fail from the Sea, and the Flood decayeth and dryeth up; ſo Man Lyeth down, and Riſeth not till the Heavens be no more. They ſhall not awake, or riſe out of their Sleep,</hi> Job 14.7.—12. And the <hi>Heathen Poet</hi> long ago obſerved
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:107489:98"/> the like of the <hi>Sun.</hi> The <hi>Sun</hi>'s Set and Riſe, Set and Riſe again: But <hi>We,</hi> when <hi>We</hi> Set, are covered with <hi>Eternal Night.</hi> No repeated Light or Day ſucceeds.</p>
            <p>O therefore, timely and wiſely Improve the Preſent! That had need be done well, which can be done but once; and admits no doing it again, to remedy the Errours of doing ill at firſt: And ſuch, above all things, is the Work of <hi>Dying,</hi> and finiſhing our Dayes Work, before the <hi>Night</hi> ſurprize us. The <hi>Proverb</hi> tells us, <hi>Three Things require greateſt Caution, and moſt prudent Circumſpection,</hi> Marriage, Battle, Death: Upon this Account, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their Conſequents are like to laſt.</hi> Yet the <hi>Firſt</hi> of theſe excludes not all poſſible Relief. Good Counſel may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim, Patience may bear, and Wiſdom may improve the Inconvenience, or the Death of the Party, which makes the Yoke unequal and uneaſy, may take it off the Grieved Party's Neck, that it ſhall not alwayes gall here: And at far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt, <hi>Death</hi> will Diſſolve the Bond, that it ſhall not be alwayes troubleſome.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>Second,</hi> though dangerous, is not wholly deſperate: He that hath loſt a Battle, ſuffer'd a Defeat and Rout, may Rally and Recruit; and though it
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:107489:99"/> coſt him Dear, may learn Experience for more wary Conduct, and may expect a more Propitious Fortune. But he that <hi>Dyes</hi> Unpardoned and Ungodly, that is, before his <hi>Work</hi> is done, he is undone to all Intents and Purpoſes; no Remedy, or Hope of Remedy, remains to all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity.</p>
            <p>And as the fore-nam'd Reaſons ſhew it impoſſible to Work when this <hi>Night</hi> hath actually overtaken us; ſo the <hi>Laſt</hi> which follows, ſhould excite and quicken us, to the uttermoſt, to be before-hand with it. For,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> This <hi>Night</hi> makes haſt. The <hi>Text</hi> tells you, <hi>It cometh;</hi> and I tell you, and Experience tells you, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> (in effect) tells you, <hi>It comes apace, it comes quickly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Time</hi> is painted with long Wings; and no Wings are pruned for ſo ſwift a flight: It flows like a <hi>Torrent,</hi> and ſweeps us away with it: There's no ſtemming this <hi>Tyde.</hi> And 'tis as Uncertain, as 'tis Swift: Thy <hi>Pulſe</hi> beats inceſſantly, and thy <hi>Breath</hi> is puffing out, and drawing in each Moment; and thou knoweſt not, that the <hi>One</hi> ſhall repeat its Stroaks; or the <hi>Other,</hi> be Reſtored thee once more.</p>
            <pb n="65" facs="tcp:107489:99"/>
            <p>This <hi>Night</hi> comes, like a <hi>Thief</hi> in the <hi>Night:</hi> When we lye ſtill and ſleep, that wakes, and is in perpetual Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>And this may ſuffice for the Proof of this Obſervation:</p>
            <p>That the Conſideration of the Work we have to do, and the Time allowed and limited for the Doing of it, ſhould engage us to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tmoſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, and Speed, in doing of it.</p>
            <p>I now proceed to the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſeful Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of this Weighty Truth, with equal Plainneſs.</p>
            <p>And if the Work we have to do, and the Seaſon allowed and limited for the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it in, engage us to ſuch Diligence and Speed in the doing of it. This ſerves,</p>
            <p n="1">1. To <hi>Juſtify</hi> thoſe, who act according to theſe Engagements.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To <hi>Condemn</hi> thoſe, who neglect them, or act contrary to them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To <hi>Exhort</hi> and <hi>Excite</hi> us all, to act ſuitably to them, by ſhewing all Diligence and Speed, about our Great Work.</p>
            <pb n="66" facs="tcp:107489:100"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> This <hi>Juſtifyes</hi> the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Zeal</hi> of thoſe, who Live up to, and act accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to theſe Engagements. And I wiſh to <hi>God,</hi> the Number were Greater, that deſerves ſuch Encouragement. But becauſe they are ſo few, therefore do they need it the more: For Good Company con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms Good Reſolutions; and when ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny walk together, they embolden each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and mutually ſtrengthen one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Hands and Hearts. But the <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row-Way,</hi> which leads to the <hi>Streight-Gate,</hi> being found and trodden by ſo few; and they meeting with ſo much Oppoſition, to ſtop them in it, or divert them out of it, do greatly need all the Encouragements that can be given them: For Prophane, Ungodly Men hate them, and Proud and Formal <hi>Phariſees</hi> deſpiſe them, and reproach them: And all that are ſo buſy in doing the Work of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Maſter, are mad againſt them for their Diligence about their Maſter's, and their Father's Buſineſs. <hi>He that departeth from Evil, maketh himſelf a Prey,</hi> Iſa. 59.15. God's <hi>Heritage is a Speckled Bird; the Birds about her, are againſt her,</hi> Jer. 12.9.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Enmity</hi> betwixt the <hi>Two</hi> Seeds, is more unalterable, than the Laws
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:107489:100"/> of <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians.</hi> It diſcovered it ſelf betimes, in <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> in <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Iſaac;</hi> the <hi>Two</hi> ſignal <hi>Types</hi> of the <hi>Two</hi> Viſible kinds of Perſecution, which have prevailed in the World ever ſince; by the Mouth of the Sword, or the Sword of the Mouth.</p>
            <p>Cain, <hi>who was of that Wicked One, ſlew his Brother; and wherefore ſlew he him? Becauſe his own Works were Evil, and his Brothers Righteous,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.12. And <hi>Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael Mocked,</hi> Gen. 21.9. which in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Language, is, <hi>He that was Born after the Fleſh, perſecuted him that was Born after the Spirit,</hi> Gal. 4.29. And as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> added, for the time in which he wrote, as it was then, ſo is it now: So may we, for the <hi>times</hi> in which we Live; and ſo will they have cauſe to do, who ſhall Live after us. For the Rule, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.12. <hi>All that will live Godly in</hi> Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>ſhall ſuffer Perſecution,</hi> is as Univerſal for <hi>Ages</hi> and <hi>Places,</hi> as <hi>Perſons;</hi> no Temporary one, to expire like an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquated Law,</hi> but will laſt while this Evil World laſts; and they ſhall find it, in one kind or the other. And where the Laws pinion the Hands of <hi>Cain,</hi> the Tongue of <hi>Iſhmael</hi> will be Lawleſs; and where they dare not kill their Bodies, their
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:107489:101"/> Throats <hi>(thoſe open Sepulchres)</hi> will ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them alive, like the Grave; and with Black Mouths, full of <hi>Lyon</hi>'s Teeth, will rend their Names, and tear their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations, till they wound their very Souls. If a Volly of Lyes, or a Shower of thoſe invenom'd Arrows, bitter, rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and opprobrious Words, will ſtop you in, or fright you from your Work. The Father of Lyes hath more Tongues, than <hi>Argus</hi> had Eyes, or <hi>Briarius</hi> had Hands; and will find <hi>Monſtrous</hi> Heads enough, both whoſe Ears grow upon one ſide.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But let none of theſe Things move you; neither count your Lives, nor your Names dear to you; ſo that you may Finiſh your Courſe with Joy,</hi> Act. 20.24.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>James</hi> urges to Patience thrice in a Breath, with one of the Arguments in our <hi>Text.</hi> Jam. 5.7, 8, 9. <hi>Be patient, Brethren, unto the Coming of the Lord. Be patient, ſtabliſh your Hearts; the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the</hi> Lord <hi>draweth nigh, Grudge not, behold the Judge ſtandeth at the Door.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Gratify not the <hi>Devil,</hi> or his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſo much as to grow Remiſs at your Work, for fear of their Reproaches: But keep on your Way; though the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:107489:101"/> Dogs bark, thou'lt ſoon be paſt them, and out of the Noiſe. It would be a dear <hi>Purchaſe,</hi> to buy their Silence at the Price of abating thy <hi>Zeal</hi> for <hi>God.</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> teaches you a ſafer and better Way to do it; even <hi>by Well-doing, and by a good Converſation in</hi> Chriſt, <hi>to make them aſhamed to ſpeak Evil of you.</hi> This is the moſt Innocent <hi>Revenge</hi> you can take on them; to reſolve, the more they deride you, or reproach you for your Work, the more earneſtly to mind it, and to follow it the more diligently. And 'tis the beſt Security for your ſelves, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent being diſturbed: He that minds his Buſineſs intently, hath no Ears to hear, nor Leiſure to take notice of, what is deſign'd to interrupt him. Convince them, you are led by a better <hi>Spirit,</hi> by being able to bear with Meekneſs, their loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Slanders, &amp; moſt ſpightful Reproaches. While they cannot bear the Silent, and undeſigned Reprehenſion, your Diligence and <hi>Zeal</hi> reflects upon their Sloath &amp; Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling, in the Work of God, and their own Souls.</p>
            <p>'Tis an Immutable, and Eternal Truth; that the glorifying God, and ſaving our own Souls, is our Supream Concern, and deſerves our <hi>Firſt</hi> and <hi>Higheſt</hi> Care;
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:107489:102"/> and who ever acts according to it, ſhall in ſpight of Men and <hi>Devils,</hi> be juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as a Wiſe and good Man, in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And their Maſter's <hi>Euge, Well done good and faithful Servant! enter thou into thy Maſter's Joy,</hi> will put it out of doubt, and controverſy for ever. <hi>And Wiſdom ſhall be Juſtifyed of her Children;</hi> though Fools condemn, and the Sons of <hi>Belial</hi> Blaſpheme both the Mother, and her Off-ſpring.</p>
            <p>He that hath <hi>Truth</hi> on his ſide, and <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> on his ſide, and a well-guided <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> on his ſide, hath <hi>God</hi> Himſelf on his ſide; and need not trouble himſelf, who, or what-ever is againſt him. And thus 'tis certainly with every one, who makes <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> his Buſineſs in good Earneſt. And even the Men, whoſe Mouths Reproach you, in their Hearts muſt Reverence you: And their Conſciences will approve, what the Intereſt of their Luſts provokes them to condemn in others, that they might eſcape, being condemned of themſelves.</p>
            <p>Be not diſcouraged therefore; but take Heart; Remember He that ſaid, <hi>In the World you ſhall have Trouble;</hi> ſaid in the ſame Breath, <hi>Be ye of good Cheer, I have Over-come the World,</hi> John 16.33. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail not Brethren, that the World hates
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:107489:102"/> you;</hi> 'Tis a good Sign that you belong to <hi>God. If you were of the World, the World would love its own: But becauſe</hi> Chriſt <hi>hath choſen you out of the World, therefore the World hateth you,</hi> Joh. 15.19. 'Tis the ſame World which hated <hi>Chriſt,</hi> before it hated You, (and kill'd him too) and <hi>The Servant is not greater than his Lord.</hi> And He fore-told; <hi>If they have perſecuted Me, they will perſecute you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>If you be Reproached for the Name of</hi> CHRIST, or ſtigmatiz'd with Nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>names, for your Care in ſerious follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing His Work, care not for it; it ſhall in due time turn both to your Honour and Advantage. Garments, which were thought Uncomely, and judg'd Ridiculous on vulgar Backs, have become Modiſh, been eſteem'd Decent, yea Adorning; and have led the Faſhion, when Perſons of Honour have thought good to wear them. The <hi>Creſs</hi> which was ſo Infamous, and the greateſt Scandal in, and to the World, became the moſt Honourable Enſign, when the Great <hi>Conſtantine</hi> had plac't it in his Banners, to lead his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious Legions. A Deforming <hi>Scar</hi> adds Beauty to a Souldier, and is a <hi>Mark</hi> of Honour, and <hi>Trophee</hi> of his Valour, though received from an Enemy's Hand.
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:107489:103"/> Moſt ignominious Names, which were impos'd as Brands, to make Men hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, have chang'd their Nature; and ſo the Deſign hath been ſpoyl'd, by apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to Vertuous and Excellent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. 'Tis confeſſedly a vile and hateful Thing, to be an <hi>Heretick</hi> indeed; yet, What wiſe Man will bluſh to hear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo called by a <hi>Pagan, Jew,</hi> or <hi>Papiſt?</hi> nay, will not rather glory in't? As St. <hi>Paul</hi> did <hi>Act.</hi> 24.14. <hi>This I confeſs unto thee, that after the way which they call</hi> Hereſy, <hi>ſo worſhip I the</hi> God <hi>of my Fathers; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving all things, which are written in the Law, and in the Prophets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have enlarged on this beyond my firſt Intentions, to remove a baſe Stumbling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>block, and a moſt dirty, nay moſt deviliſh Scandal out of your Way, (which, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever firſt kindled, hath run like Fire in the Stubble, God in Mercy quench it) that is, That if a Man be zealous in Religion, live as if he did believe indeed there is an Heaven and Hell, and that the Way to either, is ſuch as the Word of God deſcribes; that thinks it is <hi>Duty,</hi> and his <hi>Wiſdome,</hi> to <hi>work</hi> out his own <hi>Salvation with fear and trembling:</hi> That ownes he hath a work appointed him of God, which requires the whole Man to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:107489:103"/> it, and therefore applyes himſelf to it accordingly: In a word, That dares not venture his Eternal Eſtate upon a few eaſy <hi>Ritual</hi> Obſervances, without the <hi>Life &amp; Power of Godlyneſs;</hi> &amp; thinks <hi>Judgment, Mercy,</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> to be of equal, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more Concernment, <hi>than Tything of Anniſe, Mynt, and Cummin;</hi> though he neither deſpiſe, nor neglect the latter in their Place. Such a Man muſt have ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Reflections made upon him, be he Miniſter, or be he private Chriſtian; there is a ſecret Inquiſition to inquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; and they return him ſuſpected of ſome kind of Heretical Pravity: <hi>He is not Right; He is at leaſt half a</hi> Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natick; <hi>He is not through Pac'd; not a True Son of the Church;</hi> and what not! that Sloath and Formality can invent, to hide its own Shame, by loading Holy Diligence in the Work of <hi>God,</hi> with op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrious and ſiniſter Suſpitions.</p>
            <p>This is a dreadful Stumbling-Block; the Good <hi>Lord</hi> remove it, for His Mercy ſake. I cannot ſee what the <hi>Devil</hi> can do more dangerous, than this; To per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade Men, 'tis their Intereſt to be Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; to force them to be cold and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in <hi>Religion,</hi> in their own Defence; and to fright them from keeping Pace
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:107489:104"/> with <hi>God</hi> in His Wayes, or being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in His Work, with all their Might; for fear of being thought and called, what would render them more Obnoxious, than the deepeſt Prophaneſs, or fouleſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery: And their Zeal would be as dangerous to them, as <hi>Paul</hi>'s Learning was to him in <hi>Feſtus</hi>'s Judgment; quite beſide themſelves, <hi>Too much Zeal hath made them Mad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Good <hi>Lord!</hi> What do ſuch Men think of the <hi>Holy Bible,</hi> of our Bleſſed <hi>Saviour</hi>'s Example, and Holy Doctrine, of the Primitive <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and Holy <hi>Martyrs?</hi> Were all theſe ſtark mad? That all muſt be eſteemed ſo, who endeavour to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them, though (Alas!) at too great a Diſtance. And, What do ſuch Men think of the Tremendous <hi>Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi> Or, Do they indeed believe, there ſhall be ſuch a Day?</p>
            <p>I fear, if theſe Obſcure Papers chance to fall into the Hands of ſome of theſe Hot Men; they may be ready to act the Part of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> and my ſelf be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to ſuffer that of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Recorded <hi>Act.</hi> 19. For Guilt is a very Teachy, and a very Vindictive <hi>thing.</hi> But, I appeal to the <hi>Searcher of Hearts,</hi> I deſigne not the Reproach of Our <hi>Church;</hi> but its

            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> To a <hi>Speedy</hi> Setting about this Work. <hi>Young Man,</hi> I ſay unto thee, <hi>Ariſe:</hi> And Oh! that <hi>Chriſt</hi> would vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to accompany this Word with ſuch a Power of His Spirit, as might ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it as effectual to ſome <hi>Dead</hi> Soul, as they were upon the <hi>Dead</hi>-Son of the <hi>Widdow of Naim.</hi> Luk. 7. <hi>Awake thou that ſleepeſt, ſtand forth from the Dead,

            <p>But becauſe it often is with <hi>Young Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> (if I may make ſuch an Alluſion) as it was with <hi>Lazarus,</hi> when <hi>Chriſt</hi> call'd him forth of his Grave; Joh. 11.44. <hi>He that was Dead, came forth bound Hand and Foot, with Grave-Cloaths, and his Face bound about with a Napkin:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Jeſus ſaid unto them, Looſe him, and let him go.</hi> When they begin to be quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and have ſome Senſe of the Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of ſpeedy Walking in the Wayes of <hi>God;</hi> yet their Heads are bound about, they are muffled, and blind-folded with <hi>Prejudices,</hi> and cannot ſee their Way; and bound Hand and Foot with <hi>Grave-Cloaths,</hi> hamper'd and ſhackled with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> and <hi>Objections,</hi> that they can neither walk in <hi>God</hi>'s Way, nor work for Him: I will endeavour to looſe them, and knock off their Fetters, and remove the Lets and Hinderances of their <hi>Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and their <hi>Speed;</hi> and I ſhall do it briefly: For though there may be many Fooliſh <hi>Cavils,</hi> there can be neither wiſe,

            <p>
               <hi>Firſt</hi> then, 'tis <hi>Objected,</hi> That <hi>Religion</hi> is too ſerious a Work for <hi>Young People;</hi> as the <hi>Philoſopher</hi> ſaid, <hi>Young Men</hi> were not fit Hearers of the Precepts of <hi>Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;</hi> but, <hi>Poſtquam deferbuit aetas,</hi> after the Heats of <hi>Youth</hi> are boyl'd over; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their Luſts and Paſſions have ſpent themſelves, and they have <hi>Sow'd their Wild Oats,</hi> as your Common <hi>Phraſe</hi> is. The Heat of <hi>Youth</hi> is a kind of Sickneſs; and no wiſe <hi>Phyſitian</hi> adminiſters in the Heighth of the <hi>Paroxiſme;</hi> but ſtayes till the Fit be over.

               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Theſe Compariſons prove no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and are as eaſily ſleighted as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. For the main <hi>Objection:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis true, <hi>Religion</hi> is a very ſerious Thing; and therefore, the fitter to reſtrain the Extravagancy of <hi>Youthful Luſts;</hi> which, by how much the more Impetuous they are, by ſo much the ſtronger <hi>Curbs</hi> they need, to reſtrain and keep them in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:107489:110"/> And 'tis the <hi>Excellency</hi> of the Word of <hi>God,</hi> and its high Commendation; that 'tis an <hi>Antidote</hi> ſtrong enough to purge out ſuch a Poyſon. <hi>Where-with-all ſhall a Young Man cleanſe his Ways? By taking heed thereto, according to thy Word,</hi> Pſal. 119.9. For a Man to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge his Luſts, and profeſs <hi>Religion,</hi> I confeſs, were a way to deſecrate and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute ſo Holy a <hi>thing.</hi> But <hi>Religion</hi> min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in Sincerity, will ſubdue and morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy them; <hi>And give Subtilty to the Simple, to the Young Man Knowledge and Diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> Prov. 1.4. Though <hi>Youth</hi> hath its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences, which <hi>Religion</hi> will Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect; it alſo hath its Advantages which <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> will Improve. 'Tis more Vigorous and Active, more Suſceptive and Reten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, more Free and Diſ-engaged, more Unprejudiced and Diſ-incumbred, than the following <hi>Stages</hi> of Life: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, moſt acceptable to <hi>God,</hi> and fitteſt to be Conſecrated to His Work.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Religion</hi> will Relieve againſt the Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of <hi>Youth,</hi> and give the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of <hi>Age,</hi> and make them Men in Knowledge and Gravity, who are but <hi>Youths</hi> in Years: For Honourable <hi>Age</hi> is not that which ſtandeth in Length of Time, nor that is meaſured by Number
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:107489:110"/> of Years; <hi>But Wiſdom is gray Hair un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Men, and an unſpotted Life is Old Age.</hi> Wiſd. 4.8, 9. yea, gives <hi>Prerogatives</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove it: For Young <hi>David</hi> was Wiſer than his <hi>Teachers,</hi> and <hi>had more <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding than the Antients, becauſe he kept</hi> God's <hi>Precepts.</hi> Yea, the Wiſe <hi>King</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the Diſproportion very high, when he tells us, Eccleſ. 4.13. <hi>That a Poor and Wiſe Child, is better than an Old and Fooliſh King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Religion</hi> therefore is not too ſerious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for a <hi>Child,</hi> ſeeing it can make a <hi>Child</hi> Serious; nor in danger to to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced by the Levity of <hi>Youth,</hi> ſeeing it can Cloath even <hi>Youth</hi> with Gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> A <hi>Second Objection</hi> againſt <hi>Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Piety,</hi> is ſuggeſted by Superſtitious Fear, that they ſhall <hi>Dye</hi> preſently, if they grow Devout; as ſome <hi>Fools</hi> think they muſt, if they once make their <hi>Wills.</hi>

A Puff of Light Air, ſoon blown away: The <hi>Healthieſt</hi> Conſtitutions, are alwayes as ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to External Accidents, as the moſt <hi>Crazy;</hi> and uſually more ſubject to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious, and Contagious Diſeaſes. And I appeal to your own Obſervation, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (compare one Family with another) the Number of Deceaſed Children, do not far exceed that of ſurviving, both Parents and Brethren. Therefore, truſt not to that, which hath deceived ſo many; nor lean upon that broken Reed, <hi>(The Hope of Long Life)</hi> which hath more than woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Hand, hath ſhivered under <hi>Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands,</hi> that put much Streſs upon it, and let them drop into the <hi>Infernal Pit,</hi> from whence is no Redemption.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The <hi>Example</hi> of moſt Young People; and why may not they venture, as well as others?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 'Tis too true, too many <hi>Young People</hi> defer their <hi>Repentance,</hi> and <hi>delay</hi> their <hi>Work:</hi> But 'tis as true, 'tis like to coſt them <hi>Dear,</hi> and prove their Ruin; and if thou wilt be <hi>Damn'd</hi> for Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, thou art more <hi>Cruel</hi> to thy ſelf, than <hi>Kind</hi> to them. The <hi>Moſt</hi> are the <hi>Worſt;</hi> and we are warned againſt following a
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:107489:113"/> 
               <hi>Multitude</hi> in evil. <hi>The many</hi> are in the broad, the bad way, and the way to life is found by few. We muſt live by <hi>Rule,</hi> not by <hi>Example:</hi> and if thou wilt needs follow <hi>Precedents,</hi> chuſe the wiſeſt, not the <hi>moſt.</hi> And thoſe are they that take Time by the Fore-lock, will not part with the <hi>Subſtance,</hi> to catch at the <hi>Shadow,</hi> nor neglect the Preſent, in hopes of the Future; which is uncertain, whether it ſhall ever be: Nay, moſt probable, it ſhall not; and moſt certain, it may never be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly</hi> and <hi>Laſtly,</hi> The ſtrongeſt <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection</hi> is raiſed from abuſed <hi>Scriptures.</hi> That <hi>Poyſon</hi> is moſt dangerous, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth it ſelf moſt ſpeedily, and incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably, which is adminiſtred in the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Liquors. When the <hi>Devil</hi> had Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence to <hi>tempt</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> of Glory, he had Cunning to aſſault Him with this Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon; <hi>It is written, He ſhall give his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels Charge over thee,</hi> &amp;c. And ſo, when he ſets his Snares for poor Men, if he can Wire-draw a <hi>Text,</hi> to make a <hi>Ginn</hi> of it, if he can abuſe the <hi>Word,</hi> and make what <hi>ſhould be a Light to our Feet, and a Lanthorne to our Paths,</hi> to guide us to Heaven, an <hi>Ignis Fatuus,</hi> or a <hi>Will-i'th'Wiſp,</hi>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:107489:113"/> to amuſe us, and wilder us, and make us loſe our ſelves in <hi>Bogs,</hi> and among <hi>Precipices;</hi> he hath done his Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and concludes he is ſure of us.</p>
            <p>Now, amongſt many, theſe are not the ſeldomeſt preſt to ſerve his Deſign:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>At what time ſo-ever a Sinner repenteth him of his Sin, I will put all his Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs out of My Remembrance, ſaith the Lord,</hi> Ezek. 18.11. And as he will <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail,</hi> and leave ſome-what out; ſo he will put a Signal <hi>Emphaſis</hi> upon what he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects ſhould wound and kill. <hi>At what time ſo-ever;</hi> though never ſo late: And that in the 20th. of St. <hi>Matthew, They that went not into the Vineyard till the Eleventh Hour;</hi> at Five a Clock, but one Hour before they all left Work; yet theſe far'd as well, <hi>Had every Man a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> as much <hi>Wages,</hi> as <hi>They that went in the Morning, and bore the Burden and Heat of the Day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But abeve all, the <hi>Thief</hi> on the <hi>Croſs;</hi> that's his <hi>Goliah</hi>'s <hi>Sword,</hi> that's his <hi>Inchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Spear,</hi> his truſty <hi>Truncheon!</hi> What need you make ſuch haſte? Remember you not the <hi>Thief</hi> on the <hi>Croſs?</hi> He was Nail'd to the <hi>Fatal Tree,</hi> a <hi>Thief,</hi> a Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creant, as wicked a <hi>Villain,</hi> as ever liv'd; and yet you know, he <hi>Repented,</hi> and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:107489:114"/> went that very Day to <hi>Paradiſe;</hi> which it may be he never thought on before, nor ever deſired, or prepared himſelf to go to. Theſe I confeſs, are <hi>deadly Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,</hi> and he makes many Mortal Thruſts with them, and wounds and kills Eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, unwary, and unarmed Sinners; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take your Shield to Repel them, leſt they pierce you through and through.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Theſe I confeſs would bear a larger, and more Elaborate Confutation: But I hope, a briefer One may ſerve; and a little <hi>Armour</hi> well put on, may render you impregnable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt</hi> therefore, As to that of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out inſiſting upon the Exactneſs of the Words, as they are ſet down in our New <hi>Liturgy,</hi> and Correct what was more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to miſtake in the Old One.</p>
            <p>I deny not, but that <hi>Whenſoever a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Repents him truly of all his Sins, from the Bottom of his Heart, God</hi> will ſhew him Mercy: But I deny, that he who ſins <hi>Preſumptuouſly,</hi> in Confidence of <hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> Repentance, is ſure, nay, or likely to obtain it.</p>
            <p>Vain Man! Is it as <hi>eaſy</hi> to Repent, as to Sin? Canſt thou <hi>Lift</hi> thy ſelf up out of a <hi>Deep Well,</hi> becauſe thou canſt <hi>Throw</hi>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:107489:114"/> thy ſelf down into the <hi>Bottom</hi> of it? Doth not this depend <hi>immediately</hi> upon his Help, whoſe <hi>Gift</hi> Repentance is? Muſt not <hi>God</hi> give thee both <hi>Space</hi> to Repent in, and <hi>Grace</hi> to Repent with, if ever thou Repent in truth? And though he hath often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd <hi>Pardon</hi> to <hi>Repentance,</hi> he hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver promis'd <hi>Repentance</hi> to Preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Sinners; but contrarily, <hi>To wound the Head, and Hairy Scalp of them, who go on in their Iniquities.</hi> This Courſe har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens thy Heart againſt <hi>God,</hi> that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Repent: and may juſtly harden His Heart againſt thee, never to give thee <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance;</hi> it being but a <hi>Peradventure,</hi> in the moſt favourable Caſe. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.25, 26. <hi>If</hi> God <hi>Peradventure will give them Repentance, to the acknowledging of the Truth, and that they may Recover themſelves out of the Snare of the Devil, who are led Captive of him at his Will.</hi> Though all Sin is dangerous; yet none ſin ſo deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, as thoſe who ſin upon <hi>Preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of <hi>Repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to that of the <hi>Eleventh Hour:</hi> Take heed of ſtretching <hi>Parables</hi> too far. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, remark the Words in <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.7. <hi>When he went out at the Eleventh Hour, and ſaid, Why ſtand ye here Idle all the Day long?</hi> They <hi>anſwered</hi> roundly, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:107489:115"/> no Man hath Hired us.</hi> This is a fair Excuſe. They come ſoon enough, who come at the <hi>Firſt Call;</hi> and they go to work in due time, who go as ſoon as they are <hi>ſent,</hi> or their Work is <hi>ſet them.</hi> But, What is this to you, who have been call'd a <hi>Hundred times,;</hi> yea, commanded to your Work a <hi>Thouſand? He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing often Reproved, hardneth his Neck, ſhall ſuddenly be deſtroyed, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Remedy,</hi> Prov. 29.1. how well ſoever he may <hi>ſpeed,</hi> who obeyes the <hi>Firſt</hi> Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God gives him.</p>
            <p>As to that of the <hi>Thief</hi> on the <hi>Croſs;</hi> who went on a <hi>Sinner,</hi> and came off a <hi>Saint:</hi> As the <hi>Croſs</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was a <hi>ſcandal</hi> to many at the <hi>Firſt;</hi> ſo the <hi>Croſs</hi> of this Happy <hi>Thief,</hi> is an Unhappy Occaſion of <hi>ſtumbling</hi> and <hi>falling</hi> to not a few, to this very Day. But many have been the <hi>Anſwers,</hi> which have been given, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move it out of the way; that no more may ſtumble at it:</p>
            <p>There were <hi>Two Thieves</hi> Crucifyed at that time, and but <hi>One Repented;</hi> and thou mayſt prove the <hi>Impenitent One:</hi> and, What will thy Caſe then be? But that's the very leaſt that can be ſaid. There is but this <hi>One Example</hi> in all the <hi>Bible;</hi> and this <hi>One</hi> is Recorded, that
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:107489:115"/> 
               <hi>none</hi> might <hi>Deſpair;</hi> and but this <hi>One,</hi> that <hi>none</hi> may <hi>Preſume.</hi> And this being a ſingle <hi>Inſtance,</hi> (we ſay, One <hi>Swallow</hi> makes no <hi>Summer</hi>) thou may'ſt as well Spur thy <hi>Aſs,</hi> till thou make him <hi>ſpeak,</hi> becauſe thou readeſt, <hi>Balaam</hi>'s <hi>Aſs</hi> once ſpake with Man's Voyce, (as Holy Mr. <hi>Greenham</hi> ſmartly upbraids ſuch Men's Folly) as promiſe thy ſelf the like.</p>
            <p>But conſider the Time; it was when our <hi>Lord</hi> was <hi>Crucifyed</hi> in greateſt <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny;</hi> and He thought good to ſhew His <hi>Royalty,</hi> and an extraordinary Munificence, to counterballance the <hi>Infamy</hi> of His Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Accurſed Tree; and it was a thing becoming His Wiſdom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to give a <hi>Signal Inſtance,</hi> and <hi>Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Proof,</hi> of the <hi>Efficacy</hi> of His Death, and His <hi>Father</hi>'s Acceptance of His <hi>Obedience.</hi> And 'tis a great Word one ſpeaks upon it; <hi>You may as well expect</hi> Chriſt <hi>to be Crucifyed again, as expect ſuch another In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of ſuch unuſual Mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Kings may on their <hi>Coronation-Day</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the Priſons, and let looſe Offenders, ſuch as they will not Pardon afterwards, in all their <hi>Reign.</hi> The <hi>Conduits</hi> may then flow with <hi>Wine,</hi> though they run Common <hi>Water</hi> alwayes after: And the <hi>Thief</hi>'s Caſe was Extraordinary, which might in
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:107489:116"/> ſome Meaſure entitle him to Extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Favour. He Pleaded <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Cauſe openly, Rebuked his Fellow-Sufferer, Own'd a Rejected <hi>Saviour,</hi> when the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Elders</hi> not only Condemned Him, but <hi>Mocked</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemed</hi> Him; and when His own Followers fled and forſook Him, and were either afraid, or aſham'd to Own Him. And was, as one calls him, <hi>The Apoſtle of the Apoſtles;</hi> aptly ſupplying <hi>Judas</hi>'s Room: For, whom he (who was a <hi>Thief,</hi> Joh. 12.6.) had Betray'd to the <hi>Croſs,</hi> this Good <hi>Thief</hi> Preached, whil'ſt he was upon it.</p>
            <p>More <hi>Objections</hi> might have been Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and as eaſily <hi>Anſwered,</hi> and more have been ſaid to <hi>Theſe;</hi> but I hope, this may ſuffice.</p>
            <p>I beſeech you therefore, <hi>All,</hi> eſpecially you <hi>Young Ones,</hi> into whoſe Hands this may fall; up, and be doing, <hi>Defer</hi> not a Day, not an Hour longer, e're you ſet upon this Great Work; Grieve not the Bleſſed <hi>Spirit,</hi> when He knocks, when He calls at the Door of thy Heart. Say not to Him, as <hi>Faelix</hi> did to <hi>Paul; Go thy way now, when I have a Convenient Time, I will ſend for thee;</hi> leſt that Time never
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:107489:116"/> come, or He <hi>deſpiſe</hi> thy ſending for Him, who haſt <hi>rejected</hi> Him ſo often, when He came of His own Accord. But take heed you be not Diſcouraged at the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of a New Work: <hi>Firſt</hi> On-ſets are moſt <hi>Difficult.</hi> 'Tis the Neck <hi>unaccuſtomed</hi> to the <hi>Yoke,</hi> that winches and complains of it: A little <hi>Wearing</hi> it, will make it <hi>Eaſy.</hi> He that hath begun well, hath half Finiſhed. As 'tis ſafeſt to Reſiſt <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> in the Beginning; ſo 'tis the wiſeſt Courſe, to <hi>begin</hi> quickly and reſolvedly, what is <hi>Good,</hi> and muſt be done: The <hi>Engine</hi> which is hardly ſet a-going, is <hi>eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> continued to move, when 'tis once in Motion. It hath been obſerved, moſt are Converted <hi>Young,</hi> that are ever Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted truly. O ye <hi>Young Ones,</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that Obſervation by your <hi>Speedy</hi> Turning unto <hi>God!</hi> But then, reſolve to proceed in your Work with <hi>Diligence,</hi> which is the Laſt Thing to be ſpoken to.</p>
            <p>I might in this place, add more Motives to quicken your Speed: But I ſhall rather refer you back (at preſent) to thoſe in the preceding Diſcourſe; and ſubjoyn here thoſe <hi>Conſiderations,</hi> which may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke your Diligence: Amongſt which, a
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:107489:117"/> Place will be found to touch this String a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain conveniently.</p>
            <p>Now, in this <hi>Exhortation</hi> to Diligence, <hi>Three Things</hi> will be requiſite, to render it more effectual:
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>To Caution you againſt the Hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, which Obſtruct it.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>To Direct you to the Helps, which Promote it.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. <hi>To Lay down the Motives, which Provoke to it.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That you may proceed with <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence</hi> in the Work of <hi>God,</hi> beware of the <hi>Hinderances,</hi> which would <hi>Obſtruct</hi> it: Which are of <hi>Two</hi> ſorts:</p>
            <p>The <hi>Firſt,</hi> we may call <hi>Doctrinal,</hi> or in Opinion.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second, Real,</hi> or in Practice.</p>
            <p>I ſhall briefly point at <hi>Three</hi> of either ſort.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Take heed of eſteeming it ſo <hi>Eaſy,</hi> that it needs it not.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That, on the contrary Extream, you judge it not ſo <hi>Difficult,</hi> and even <hi>Impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> that no <hi>Diligence</hi> can effect it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That you think not ſo <hi>Meanly,</hi> and <hi>Baſely</hi> of it, that it doth not deſerve it.</p>
            <pb n="101" facs="tcp:107489:117"/>
            <p>When a Buſineſs is propounded to be done, if it appear under any of theſe <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> no Wiſe Man will attempt it with any Vigour: For, Why ſhould he beſtow a great deal of Pains and Labour, when he plainly fore-ſees, it is either needleſs, and may be ſpar'd, or will prove uſeleſs, and muſt be loſt. But if it appear very <hi>Hard</hi> and <hi>Difficult,</hi> but yet <hi>Hopeful</hi> and <hi>Poſſible</hi> to be attained; and withal, moſt <hi>Neceſſary,</hi> and very <hi>Excellent,</hi> and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous: This will Excite and Raiſe that Soul, that hath any Principles of Prudence, Generoſity, or Care of its own Good.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Account not this Work ſo <hi>Eaſy,</hi> as 'tis moſt evident too many do; who under fulleſt Convictions, and profeſs'd Acknowledgments, that there is ſuch an <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Hell,</hi> as the <hi>Bible</hi> deſcribes; and that it ſo infinitely concerns them to obtain the One, and eſcape the Other, as is there declared; yet Live ſo ſecurely, and negligently, that they proclaim to all the World, they think it next to <hi>Impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,</hi> to miſcarry; and <hi>ſwear</hi> by their <hi>Hopes of Salvation,</hi> as the moſt <hi>Sacred Aſſeveration;</hi> while they are running headlong in the Broad-way, that leads to Deſtruction.</p>
            <pb n="102" facs="tcp:107489:118"/>
            <p>Surely, theſe muſt think <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Work</hi> very <hi>Eaſy,</hi> who flatter themſelves, that they can carry it on ſufficiently, while they are ſerving the <hi>Devil,</hi> and their <hi>Luſts,</hi> with both Hands greedily. It may not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent to mind ſuch Men of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Fryar</hi>'s Lenten Sermon; which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore many <hi>Cardinals,</hi> and Great Men of that Court, he began abruptly thus:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>St.</hi> Peter <hi>was a</hi> Fool, <hi>and St.</hi> Paul <hi>was a</hi> Fool, <hi>and all the</hi> Primitive Chriſtians <hi>were meer</hi> Fools; <hi>who took ſuch a deal of Care and Pains, to pleaſe</hi> God, <hi>and ſave their Souls; and thought the Way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, was by Self-Denyal and Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Prayers and Faſting; by Severities, and denying the Pomps of this Wicked World: And You at</hi> Rome, <hi>indulge your ſelves in Eaſe and Sloth, live in your Luſts and Luxury, and ſpend your Time in Pomp and Pleaſure; and yet account your ſelves very good</hi> Chriſtians; <hi>and doubt not, but you ſhall be ſaved: But, at laſt, You'll be found the</hi> Fools, <hi>and They the</hi> Wiſe Men.</p>
            <p>For 'tis the part of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> to propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the <hi>Means</hi> to the <hi>End;</hi> and 'tis great <hi>Folly,</hi> to waſte Time and Strength, and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:107489:118"/> make a great Stir and Buſtle about that, which may be done (as you ſay) with a wet Finger; and 'tis ſo alſo, to act coldly and faintly in that, which cannot be accompliſh't without great Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry.</p>
            <p>I beſeech you therefore, beware of ſuch an Opinion, as will greatly tempt you to be Remiſs in the Work of <hi>God;</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member who bid, <hi>Strive to enter in at the Streight-Gate;</hi> withal, telling you, <hi>That many of thoſe who ſtrive, ſhall not be able to get in:</hi> What then ſhall become of them, who <hi>ſtrive</hi> not? <hi>The Violent take the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> As he that Asks faintly, beſpeaks a <hi>Denyal;</hi> ſo he that Acts faintly, will be ſurely <hi>Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides what was ſaid before, it were eaſie to add many Evidences, to prove this <hi>Work</hi> to be Hard; and that 'tis very Reaſonable, it ſhould be ſo. The Way is Steep and Slippery, 'tis hard to climb it; the Enemies are Many and Mighty, that Oppoſe thee; thy Skill and Strength is ſmall; Nature will recoyl, and draw back; and ſingle Nature is hardly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come: and Cuſtom of Sinning, is a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Nature; and doubtleſs the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and no Diſcipline, is ſo hard, as
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:107489:119"/> for him to learn to do Well, who hath been accuſtomed to do Evil. <hi>Self</hi> is a bold Competitor with <hi>God;</hi> and muſt be uſed Roughly, or it will be ſerv'd before Him, and ſet up above Him: And for thy own Dear Sake, thou wilt be prone to cry, as <hi>David</hi> for his Darling <hi>Abſolom; Deal gently with it, for my Sake:</hi> And, by a ſtrange Fondneſs, thou wilt ſpare the <hi>Traytor,</hi> which watches to deſtroy thee. Though <hi>Chriſt</hi> Rejected the Temptation, <hi>Favour thy ſelf,</hi> with a <hi>Get thee behind Me, Satan;</hi> yet when ſuch Sugar'd Words are offer'd thee, thou'lt hardly diſcern the Poyſon that's mixt with them.</p>
            <p>And there are many <hi>Reaſons,</hi> why <hi>God</hi> hath made his own Work hard; that thoſe who Wear the <hi>Crown,</hi> may Win it firſt: <hi>For a Man is not Crown'd, unleſs he ſtrive Lawfully:</hi> That he may appear Imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, in Rejecting <hi>Loyterers,</hi> and Reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Labourers:</hi> That his Servants may have Opportunity to exerciſe thoſe Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which elſe there would be no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for: That Reſt may be ſweeter af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Labour: And that <hi>God</hi>'s Grace may be Magnifyed, in aſſiſting their Weakneſs; and <hi>Satan</hi> may be more Confounded, in the Diſappointment of all his Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems.</p>
            <pb n="105" facs="tcp:107489:119"/>
            <p>Believe therefore thy Work to be hard; that thou betray not thy ſelf to Sloth and Remiſsneſs, to thy own Eternal Ruin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Yet run not into the other Extream, while thou avoydeſt this; and daſh not againſt <hi>Scylla,</hi> while thou avoyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <hi>Charybdis:</hi> Conclude not, 'tis <hi>Impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible</hi> to finiſh it by Labour; becauſe it is ſo, to accompliſh it without Labour. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair</hi> of Succeſs kills all Induſtry; and a ſuppoſed <hi>Impoſſibility</hi> of Attainment, naturally produces <hi>Deſpair.</hi> When once we ſay, <hi>There is no Hope;</hi> the next word will be, <hi>Why ſhould I wait any longer? Why ſhould I ſtrive any more?</hi> But, <hi>Be not Sloathful; but Followers of them, who through Faith and Patience inherit the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</hi> Faith and Patience will do that, which Sloth and the want of them can never do.</p>
            <p>And watch carefully againſt that Snare, <hi>Satan</hi> layes in the way of ſo many; <hi>If I be not Elected, all my Labour will be in vain: I cannot alter</hi> God's <hi>Decrees.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Vain Creature! What haſt thou to do with <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Decrees?</hi> Who made thee of His Council? Mind thou what is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Word, <hi>Which is nigh thee in
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:107489:120"/> thy Mouth, and in thy Heart:</hi> Not what is written in the Secret <hi>Records</hi> of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Read <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.29.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſecret things belong to the</hi> Lord <hi>our</hi> God: <hi>But thoſe things which are Revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, belong to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, and to our Children, for ever; that we may do all the Words of this Law.</hi> And <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.11, 12, 14. <hi>This Commandment, which I command thee this Day, is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off. It is not in Heaven, that thou ſhouldſt ſay, Who ſhall go up for us to Heaven, and bring it to us, that we may hear it, and do it. But the Word is ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h unto thee in thy Mouth, and in thy Heart, that thou may'ſt do it. See, I have ſet before you this Day, Life and Good, Death and Evil</hi> Compare <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.6, —9. <hi>This is the Word of Faith which we Preach; If thou Confeſs with thy Mouth, and believe in thine Heart, thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not, if thou be <hi>Elected,</hi> thou ſhalt be <hi>Saved,</hi> whether thou believeſt, whether thou workeſt out thy Salvation, or no: This is to begin at the wrong End; as if a Man would begin to Build a Houſe at the Roof, and Build downwards; Build the Roof in the Air, before any thing were laid on Earth to bear it up. St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:107489:120"/> teaches another Method, 2 Pet. 1.5. <hi>Giving all Diligence, add to your Faith Vertue,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For if theſe Things be in you, and abound, they make you, that you ſhall be neither Barren nor <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfruitful,</hi> &amp;c. And, Verſ. 10. <hi>Giving Diligence to make your Calling and Election ſure.</hi> Firſt <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> then <hi>Election;</hi> and <hi>Diligence</hi> to know, and to <hi>make ſure</hi> Both.</p>
            <p>How many <hi>Scriptures</hi> ſpeak the ſame Senſe, (nay, 'tis the Scope of all the <hi>Scripture</hi>) with <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.7, 8, 9. <hi>Whatſoever a Man Soweth, that ſhall he alſo Reap; for he that ſoweth to his Fleſh, ſhall of the Fleſh reap Corruption; but he that ſoweth to the Spirit, ſhall of the Spirit reap Life Everlaſting. And let us not be weary in Well-doing; for in due Seaſon we ſhall Reap, if we faint not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, neither ſcare thy ſelf from thy <hi>Duty,</hi> nor flatter thy ſelf in thy <hi>Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,</hi> by any <hi>Decrees</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which are hidden from thee, and thou art a Stranger to. But quicken and comfort thy ſelf with this Truth, which is written as with a <hi>Sun</hi>-beam from Heaven; <hi>That no</hi> Decree <hi>of</hi> God <hi>ſhall ever ſhut him out of Heaven, who with ſincere Faithfulneſs, and humble Diligence, attends</hi> God's <hi>Work, according to his Written Word: Neither
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:107489:121"/> ſhall any</hi> Decree <hi>of</hi> God <hi>admit him into Heaven, who ſecurely and ſlothfully neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects it.</hi> And if after thou haſt got over that Stumbling-Block of <hi>Fear'd Impoſſibility;</hi> yet thou ſtickeſt, and art frighted at, the Difficulty: Conſider, 'tis no greater than the Wiſe and Holy <hi>God</hi> thinks fit to make it, and that for Righteous and Holy <hi>Reaſons;</hi> and He knows how to proportion every Man's Work to his Abilities: And as <hi>He will not ſuffer any of His to be Tempted above their Strength;</hi> ſo neither will he task them above their Sufficiency, they ſhall receive from Him. And thou may'ſt Counter-ballance the Hardneſs of thy Work, by weighing its Neceſſity, its Excellency, the Aſſiſtance He is ready to afford thee, the Acceptance He hath promiſed thee, and the Superlative Greatneſs of the Reward prepared for thee. So that thou may'ſt ſay; <hi>I reckon that the Sufferings of this preſent time, are not worthy to be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the Glory that ſhall be Revealed in us,</hi> Rom. 8.18 <hi>For our light Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> (and yet the Patient Bearing them, is the hardeſt peice of our work) <hi>which are but for a moment, work for us a far more Exceeding, and Eternal Weight of</hi> Glory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. as <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſaid, His
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:107489:121"/> Glory in <hi>Egypt</hi> made him <hi>Forget all his Toyl, and his Father's Houſe:</hi> So I may invert the Words; Thy Father's Houſe will make thee (in one Hour) forget all the Toyl of the <hi>Brick-Hills,</hi> and Bondage of the <hi>Egypt</hi> of this VVorld: Though to the Corrupt Senſe of Fleſh and Blood, Wicked Men ſeem to have the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of Good Men, in reſpect of their <hi>Work;</hi> yet Good Men have the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of them infinitely, in reſpect of their <hi>Maſter.</hi> The Saints may have <hi>Hard Work,</hi> but they have no <hi>Hard Maſter;</hi> but <hi>One</hi> who will help them to do their <hi>Work,</hi> and yet Reward them, as if them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves had done it. But Sinners have an <hi>Hard Maſter,</hi> with their <hi>Eaſy Work;</hi> and one hours Payment of their Wages for the Works of the Fleſh, will be more Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, than the Labour of an whole Life would have been, in the Mortifying of them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Third Hinderance</hi> of thy <hi>Diligence,</hi> to be a avoyded, is a low, a mean, a baſe <hi>Opinion</hi> of the Work, as if it deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it not. The <hi>Proverb</hi> ſaith, That <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter is not at leiſure to attend little things;</hi> and the high-ſoaring <hi>Eagle</hi> ſtoops not to catch <hi>Flyes:</hi> Nor will a Wiſe Man fiſh
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:107489:122"/> with a Golden Hook, to take Fiſh of low Value. But a better Authority asks us; <hi>Wherefore do ye ſpend Mony for that, which is not Bread? and your Labour, for that which ſatisfyeth not?</hi> Iſa. 55.2. <hi>And, What Profit hath he, who hath laboured for the Wind?</hi> Eccleſ. 5.16. and Reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them, who weary themſelves for <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Vanity, Hab.</hi> 2.13. and warns us <hi>Not to labour for the Meat that periſheth,</hi> Joh. 6. And 'tis truly a Reproach to a Man, to beſtow much Pains on that which will not anſwer it. And if the <hi>Devil,</hi> or thy own Heart, can miſ-perſwade thee concerning God's Work, and turn the ſame <hi>Weapon</hi> againſt thy Diligence in it, which God hath formed againſt thy Labouring in theirs; 'twill have the like Effect to make the Miſerable, which God deſign'd, by the Right Application of it, to make the Happy.</p>
            <p>Study therefore the <hi>Excellency</hi> of this Work, which directly tends to reſcue thee out of the Baſeſt <hi>ſlavery</hi> to <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> to repair thy Decayed Nature, to reſtore and recover the <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and make thee Partaker of the <hi>Divine Nature;</hi> to fill thy Soul with Peace, and the <hi>Angels</hi> of Heaven with Joy; to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver thee from the Hurt, and Fear of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:107489:122"/> 
               <hi>Death,</hi> and from Eternal Vengeance; and to fit thee for, and bring thee to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Glory, in <hi>God</hi>'s Kingdom: And, were there nothing elſe to be ſaid of it, or for it, that Work muſt needs be <hi>Excellent,</hi> which renders them more <hi>Excellent than their Neighbours;</hi> and denominates them the <hi>Excellent of the Earth,</hi> and ſuch as <hi>the World is not Worthy of,</hi> who are Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in it. And that Work cannot be Mean or Baſe, which the High and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious God injoynes, loves to behold us at, will reward with Incorruptible Crowns of Glory; and differs only in Degree, but not in Kind, from the Work in which all Great and Noble Souls ſhall ſpend, or rather enjoy in Eternity, with increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Joy and Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Hinderances</hi> of your <hi>Diligence,</hi> which I call <hi>Real,</hi> or in <hi>Practice;</hi> and which I warn you to beware of, are theſe <hi>Three:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Ignorance,</hi> (or Unskilfulneſs) how to ſet about it, or to manage your Work aright. There is no Work or Buſineſs can be done well, without ſome Skill and Experience; not the Meaneſt, or Eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt. The <hi>Plough-man,</hi> and the <hi>Threſher,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:107489:123"/> Iſaiah</hi> takes notice of, Chap. 28.26. <hi>His</hi> God <hi>doth inſtruct him to Diſcretion, and doth Teach him.</hi> 'Tis an eaſy thing to Read; yet deliver the Book to him that hath not learnt his Letters, and bid him Read, <hi>He ſaith, I am not Learned,</hi> Iſa. 29.12. he cannot do it. A Man that is Maſter of his Trade, and skilful at it, will diſpatch more in an Hour, without Noiſe or Buſtle; than another Man, who bungles at it, with much Toyl and Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, in an whole Day. A Man that is <hi>Inſtructed to the Kingdom of</hi> God, <hi>brings forth readily out of his Treaſury, Things New and Old.</hi> Matth. 13.52. He that knowes his Way, goes on cheerfully, and rids Ground apace, and loſes no time by ſtopping to Inquire, or Recover what he had loſt, by turning into By-paths.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Knowiedge</hi> is a leading Grace, and influenceth all our Work; and the Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a Man will direct his Way: So <hi>Ignorance</hi> is the Root of Errour, and the moſt Univerſally Deſtructive. He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do <hi>God</hi>'s Work with any Comfort and Aſſurance, who knows it not; but is ſometimes right, and ſometimes wrong, alwayes Anxious and uneaſy to himſelf: <hi>Putting Darkneſs for Light, and Light for Darkneſs; calling Good Evil, and Evil
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:107489:123"/> Good.</hi> The Blind ſwallows many a Fly, commits many a Sin, he knows not to be Sins; and if he doth good, 'tis but by Chance; he loſeth the Advantage of it, becauſe he knew it not to be ſo; and therefore, could not do it in Faith: <hi>For what-ever is not of Faith, is Sin,</hi> Rom. 14. <hi>ult.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Heart</hi> cannot be Good without <hi>Knowledge,</hi> nor thy Work Good without a Good <hi>Heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wiſdom</hi> is the Principal Thing (to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect thee in thy Work;) therefore, <hi>Get Wiſdom; and with all thy getting, get <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,</hi> Prov. 4.7. No Man can aim Right, that Shoots blindfold.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ignorance</hi> will blind thy Eyes, that thou can'ſt not ſee thy Mark, <hi>God</hi>'s Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and thy own Salvation. The <hi>Text</hi> is expreſs, That <hi>in the Night no Man can Work:</hi> And one Reaſon given to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it, was, Becauſe 'tis too dark to ſee to work in. The moſt thou can'ſt do in the <hi>Night of Ignorance,</hi> is to grope like a Blind Man; and how thou art like to Finiſh ſo curious a Work, in ſuch a caſe, I leave it to thy ſelf to Judge: Therefore, provide againſt ſo Real, and ſo Great a <hi>Hinderance.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="114" facs="tcp:107489:124"/>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> Real <hi>Hinderance</hi> is, The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging of the Fleſh, and a Deſire to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify it, by the Inordinate Love of Eaſe and Pleaſure. If this Humour prevail, and thou be Delicate, Soft, and Tender, thou wilt ſhrink and give back, at the firſt Difficulty which ſteps forth to meet thee. He is not fit to make a <hi>Souldier,</hi> that can endure no Hardſhip. <hi>Thou there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore endure Hardneſs as a Good Souldier of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.3. <hi>He that loveth Pleaſure, ſhall be a Poor Man,</hi> Prov. 21.17. <hi>And who ſo loves his Eaſe, Poverty ſhall come upon him as an Armed Man.</hi> They can never ſerve <hi>God</hi> acceptably, who ſerve their Luſts and Pleaſures willingly: And they <hi>Who are Lovers of Pleaſures more than Lovers of</hi> God, may poſſibly attain a <hi>Form of Godlyneſs,</hi> but will certainly <hi>Deny the Power of it,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.4, 5. For the <hi>Pleaſures of this World, choak the Seed of the Word, and they bring forth no Fruit unto Perfection,</hi> Luk. 8.14.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Third</hi> Real <hi>Hinderance,</hi> is, Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance with Multitude of Cares, and Worldly Affairs. This over-charges the Heart, and diſtracts the Mind, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not wait on <hi>God. No Man can ſerve</hi> God <hi>and Mammon.</hi> Our Breaſts are too
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:107489:124"/> narrow, to lodge ſo many, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Inmates. We cannot look Upwards and Downwards both at once. If, <hi>Carmina ſeceſſum ſcribentis &amp; otia poſcunt,</hi> a <hi>Poet</hi>'s Thoughts muſt be free, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intangled; <hi>Religion</hi> requires it much more: <hi>Enter thou into thy Cloſet, and ſhut to thy Door, to ſhut out Diſtractions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I deny not, but while we Live in this World, wee need the things of this World; and we may lawfully ſeek them, and uſe them: But then we muſt ſeek, and uſe them lawfully; which is done, when we keep them at due Diſtance, allow them (at moſt) but the Second Place. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe them, as if we us'd them not;</hi> remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring <hi>the Time is ſhort, and that the Faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this World paſſeth away.</hi> If <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi> domineer, and begin to deſpiſe her Miſtriſs <hi>Sarah,</hi> ſhe muſt be made to know, ſhe's but a <hi>Bond-Maid,</hi> and ſhe muſt be <hi>caſt out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next to them who cannot find an Heart to ſerve <hi>God,</hi> they are to be pittyed who cannot find Time to ſerve <hi>Him:</hi> And the truth is, they therefore can find no <hi>Time</hi> for this Work, becauſe they can find no <hi>Heart</hi> to it; and they therefore can find no Heart, becauſe the World hath ſtolen it away. 'Tis ſaid by the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:107489:125"/> 
               <hi>Prophet, Wine and Women take away the Heart,</hi> Hoſ. 4.11. And 'tis as true, Riches and Buſineſs, and Multiplicity of Affairs, and a Croud and Hurry of Employments, take it away no leſs. If ſome Men can ſcarce find <hi>time</hi> to <hi>Eat</hi> and <hi>Sleep,</hi> as well as they love their Bodies; What <hi>Time</hi> do you think, they will find to <hi>Read,</hi> and <hi>Pray,</hi> and <hi>Meditate,</hi> and ſearch their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and purify their Souls? Of all Remote Advantages, which <hi>Religion</hi> may have, I eſteem none Greater than Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement, Vacancy, a Time to be ſtill, and <hi>Commune with our Hearts,</hi> call our Wayes to Remembrance; to think, and conſider, and to have Leiſure to Converſe with <hi>God.</hi> I acknowledge the Truth of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s <hi>Vae ſoli, Woe to him that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone;</hi> yet 'tis as as true, <hi>Vae nunquam ſoli,</hi> Woe to him that will not, Woe to him that cannot; but, moſt of all, Woe to him that dares not be alone!</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second Branch</hi> of this <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe,</hi> is to Direct you to the Helps which will Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote your <hi>Diligence;</hi> which amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, are theſe:</p>
            <p>Willingneſs, Love, Wiſdom, Speed, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, Courage, Conſtancy, <hi>or</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance.</p>
            <pb n="117" facs="tcp:107489:125"/>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Willingneſs,</hi> or a Good <hi>Will</hi> to your <hi>Work.</hi> The <hi>willing</hi> Man, will be a Diligent Man. <hi>Willingneſs</hi> is the Riſe, or leading Step to <hi>Diligence.</hi> 'Tis not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Oyl to your VVheels, but the very VVheels themſelves: And Men drive heavily, like <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s <hi>Chariot</hi>'s, when the VVheels were taken off, when they want a <hi>Willing</hi> Mind to what they are enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in: VVhen on the contrary, <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs</hi> makes them like the <hi>Chariots of Aminadab, Cant.</hi> 6.12, ſets them <hi>on the Chariots of my Willing People,</hi> as the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin</hi> there. The Firſt VVork upon the Soul, is deſcribed <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3. <hi>Thy People ſhall be Willing in the Day of Thy Power.</hi> In <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Offerings</hi> for the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections were to Receive them from them who brought them <hi>with a Willing Heart,</hi> Exod. 35.5, 21, 29. And when they were <hi>Willing,</hi> they bring more than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, <hi>Exod.</hi> 36.5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Willingneſs</hi> will need a <hi>Bridle,</hi> rather than a <hi>Spur.</hi> That Picture of <hi>Diligence,</hi> drawn by <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Pen, of the <hi>Virtuous Woman,</hi> hath This inſerted, as the Soul of all the Reſt; <hi>She worketh Willingly with her Hands,</hi> Prov. 31.13.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Willingneſs</hi> to your VVork, will help your <hi>Diligence</hi> in it many wayes; For it
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:107489:126"/> will make you Docible and Careful to learn your VVork. You uſe to let Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren chuſe their Profeſſions; knowing they will learn that ſooneſt, they have moſt mind to. 'Twill make you Cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Ready in the Undertaking it. We uſe to ſay, <hi>There is nothing to a Willing Mind.</hi> What the <hi>Naturaliſt</hi> ſaith of the <hi>Hand,</hi> the <hi>Moraliſt</hi> ſaith of the <hi>Will; It is the Inſtrument of Inſtruments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Man treads that Path, in which his <hi>Will</hi> leads him, as if he did not feel the Ground he goes on. 'Tis the beſt <hi>Sauce;</hi> all things Taſte, as it doth Seaſon them: And Things are Dear or Cheap, according to the Ptice it ſets upon them. It will make Men Serious, and in good Earneſt; they will netiher ſpeak faintly, nor act cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, about what they have engag'd their <hi>Wills</hi> in. They will not trifle, as thoſe do who are <hi>in Bivio,</hi> know not their own Minds, nor what themſelves would have.</p>
            <p>Be <hi>Willing</hi> therefore to your Work; that will make you <hi>Diligent</hi> at it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Love to your Work,</hi> will dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble your <hi>Diligence</hi> about it. <hi>Love</hi> is the Flower, the Cream of <hi>Willingneſs;</hi> nay, the Quinteſſence and Spirits of it. If <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs</hi> gives Feet, <hi>Love</hi> will give
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:107489:126"/> Wings. Jacob <hi>ſerved Seven Years for</hi> Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel; <hi>and they ſeem'd but as ſo many Dayes, becauſe he Lov'd her.</hi> The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant that <hi>Lov'd</hi> his Maſter, would refuſe the <hi>Freedom</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> provided for him; and would have his <hi>Ear bored at his Door-Poſt,</hi> and be his Servant for ever; not by Conſtraint, but Choyce.</p>
            <p>No Work is Hard, no Commands is Grievous, to him that <hi>Loves.</hi> 'Tis a mighty VVeight, and excites both quick and conſtant Motion. It offers a pleaſing, welcom Violence; and conſtrains to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low whitherſoever it leads, without Strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling or Reſiſting.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Love fulfils the Law, and keeps the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments;</hi> yea, is a Law unto it ſelf, and the ſtrongeſt <hi>Scepter</hi> to rule and bow Men to Obedience; and when 'tis Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, Obedience will be ſo too.</p>
            <p>Get therefore thy Heart poſſeſs'd with <hi>Love</hi> to <hi>God:</hi> Theſe <hi>Cords</hi> will bind thee, will <hi>Charm</hi> thee to thy Work; and there's no fear, but thou wilt be <hi>Diligent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Wiſdom.</hi> This is the Soul of Diligence. A Man may make a great Buſtle to very little, yea, to very ill pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, if he be Deſtitute of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> to Contrive and Manage his Work to the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:107489:127"/> beſt Advantage. The <hi>Ant,</hi> which is the Natural <hi>Emblem</hi> of <hi>Diligence,</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>Exceeding Wiſe,</hi> Prov. 30.24, 25. <hi>Torpet robor ſine Prudentia:</hi> Strength is good for little, without good Contrivance to direct; and <hi>Wiſdom is profitable to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect,</hi> Eccleſ. 10.10. and it <hi>Strengtheneth the Wiſe more than Ten mighty Men, that are in the City,</hi> Eccleſ. 7.19. Which made Wiſe <hi>Solomon</hi> conclude, That <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is better than Strength,</hi> Eccleſ. 9.16. What will a well-rigg'd Ship do with a full Gale, without a <hi>Pilot,</hi> but daſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Rocks, or run upon the Sands? Or a Hot-mettled Horſe, without a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Rider, but heat and melt himſelf, to his own Ruin?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wiſdom</hi> will many wayes aſſiſt <hi>Diligence;</hi> for it will contrive, and find out fit means, to bring Purpoſes to paſs; or will readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cloſe with them, when they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. There is a <hi>Diligence</hi> in the Head, as well as of the Hand; to Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt, and Contrive, as well as Execute. And it will know fit Seaſons, and faſten on them, and improve them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There is a Seaſon for every Thing, and a Time to every Purpoſe under the Sun:</hi> And 'tis <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> which both knows theſe <hi>Seaſons,</hi> and knows how to uſe them.
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:107489:127"/> Labour well tim'd, is the Life of Labour. One Blow upon the Heated Iron, will do more than Twenty while it is Cold. It will alſo fore-ſee <hi>Hinderances,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent and obviate them: It will make Suppoſitions, and put Caſes, and provide accordingly: And carry with it, what it hopes it ſhall not have Occaſion for; yet would not want it, in caſe there ſhould. It will ſit down, and conſider what it has to do, and what it will coſt to finiſh it; and then provides according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <hi>Prepare thy Work without, and make it fit for thy ſelf in the Field; and after Build thy Houſe.</hi> And <hi>laſtly,</hi> It will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion Labour to Strength, that it may hold out, and not be tired.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Speed,</hi> and timely Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to thy Work, is neither the Leaſt, nor the Laſt Help to <hi>Diligence. Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> is the Life of <hi>Action.</hi> 'Tis next to doing no Time, to reſolve not to do till next Time. You would count him no Diligent Servant, who lingers and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles; and has not begun, when others have half done their Dayes Work. <hi>I made haſte, and prolonged not</hi> the Time, <hi>to keep thy Commandments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> being ask't, <hi>How he Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:107489:128"/> the World ſo ſoon, ſo young, by Thirty Years Old?</hi> Anſwered, <hi>By Defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring nothing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Caeſar,</hi> Emulous of his Glory, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued it in the ſame Methods; and us'd to be quicker in his Marches, than the Wings of <hi>Fame;</hi> and prevent the Report of his Coming, by being the <hi>Firſt Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger</hi> of it: That his Enemies ſaw him com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> before they heard he was coming; and fell on immediately: That he often came upon them, and over-came them, all at once; and the <hi>Battle</hi> was often hot, before the <hi>Day</hi> was ſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Speed</hi> hath the Promiſe of Succeſs; <hi>They that ſeek Me early, find Me,</hi> Prov. 8.17. <hi>Speed</hi> Riſes at the Firſt Call; and the Diligent Man beſpeaks the <hi>Watch-man</hi> to awake him, that he may not over-ſleep himſelf: And neither cheats it Self, nor mocks <hi>God,</hi> with the Uncivil Civility; <hi>I'le go, Sir, by and by. Modeſta negatio pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craſtinatio:</hi> Delay is but a mannerly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal, at the beſt; and but a Mask for the Rudeneſs of a flat Refuſal of Duty: And thoſe, who are aſham'd bluntly to ſay, <hi>We will not,</hi> diſguiſe their Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, by ſaying, <hi>We will here-after.</hi> But this <hi>Language</hi> is never found in the Mouth of <hi>Diligence. God</hi> charges us concerning
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:107489:128"/> our Brother; <hi>Say not to him, Go thy way, and come again to Morrow, when thou haſt it by thee,</hi> Prov. 3.28.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Speed</hi> layes no Blocks in its own way, invents no Occaſions of Delay; ſeeks no Excuſes, like idle Boys, who loſe their Books, or hide their Hats, to have ſome Pretext to play the Truants, and ſtay from School. <hi>'Tis the Slothful Man, who ſaith, There is a Lyon in the way, a Lyon is in the Streets,</hi> Prov. 26.13. When he is quickned to his Work, cryes out, Would you have me run into the <hi>Lyon</hi>'s Mouth? Would you have me undo my Self, and Family, and be ſwallowed up with Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, by neglecting my Shop to run to Church; and my own Calling, to mind <hi>God</hi>'s Work? <hi>The Way of the Slothful, is an Hedge of Thorns,</hi> Prov. 15.19. He would go if he could, if he durſt; but he dare not ſtir, for pricking his Legs: He ſhall be call'd <hi>Fool</hi> or <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natick,</hi> be Jeer'd and Laugh't at by his Old Companions, and made the <hi>Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard's Song,</hi> and Talk of all the Town. 'Tis ſafer to take Time and Leiſure. <hi>Fair and Softly, goes far in a Day:</hi> That's ſoon enough, that's ſafe.</p>
            <p>Thus Idle Men will frame Excuſes, as Idle as themſelves; but the <hi>Diligent</hi> doth
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:107489:129"/> not ſo: Nay, he'll remove the Real Ones he meets with, to his Power; he'll ſet Hand, and Shoulder both, to work; and try in earneſt, to remove Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>When Men are in haſte, they'll break open that Door with the Foot, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be unlocked with the Hand. The <hi>Nightingale,</hi> that Diligent Singer, <hi>porches</hi> with her Breaſt againſt a <hi>Thorne,</hi> that <hi>Sleep</hi> may not hinder her Melody. <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle,</hi> that Diligent Student, ſat with a <hi>Brazen Ball</hi> in his Hand, over a <hi>Baſon,</hi> that if he chanc'd to nod, the falling Ball might alarum, and raiſe him to his Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Yea, he is grieved at the very Heart, when he meets with thoſe he cannot over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; and Sits, or Stands, as upon Thorns, and could even bite the Chain which holds him.</p>
            <p>Thus a Man, that is preparing to Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip <hi>God,</hi> or to ſet a-part a Day to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, to ſpend in Devotion, in Prayer and Faſting, in Examining his Heart and Wayes, and Trying his Eſtate towards <hi>God.</hi> If ſome Occaſion intervene, to hinder him, ſome Company ſurprize, and unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly interrupt him; it ſaddens, and makes him <hi>Melancholly</hi> all the Day; and he ſends his Heart into his Cloſet, where he
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:107489:129"/> would be himſelf; and ſtayes, where he is held againſt his Will, dumpiſh, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Heart: And ſecretly cryes out againſt the Violence he ſuffers; <hi>O wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from it?</hi> And looks, and longs, and ſighs ſecretly; <hi>When ſhall I come, and appear before</hi> God? Where-as the <hi>Sloathful</hi> Man hugs himſelf, and bleſſes his propitious <hi>Stars,</hi> that furniſh him with ſuch Excuſes, to ſtop the Mouth of his own Conſcience, or ſave his Credit with his Pious Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours: I was reſolved fully to be there, to have done ſo or ſo; but juſt as I was going, in came ſuch and ſuch, or this or that fell out, which hindred me that I could not do what I was fully mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly, Speed</hi> will help thy <hi>Diligence,</hi> becauſe it will put thee in a Readyneſs to act with the <hi>firſt</hi> Opportunity, and provide it ſelf of all that's requiſite for doing ſo: It takes up its Horſe over Night, that the Morning may not ſlip a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, while he is catching. They that furniſh <hi>Poſt-Horſes</hi> on the Road, keep them ready Sadled and with Bit in Mouth. The Diligent <hi>Marriner</hi> will get all Aboard, that he may hoyſt Sail, as ſoon as ever the Winds comes fair. The Diligent <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant</hi>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:107489:130"/> hath his <hi>Loynes girded,</hi> quite ready, all his Cloaths on, to his very <hi>Girdle;</hi> which being upper-moſt, he puts on laſt; and <hi>his Light burning, that he may open to his Lord at the Firſt Knock,</hi> Luk. 12.35.</p>
            <p>Thus theſe Two will mutually influence, ſecond, and aſſiſt each other: A <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Mind</hi> will quicken thee to <hi>Speed,</hi> and <hi>Speed</hi> will many wayes promote and help thy <hi>Diligence</hi> in working.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>Induſtry</hi> is another great Help to <hi>Diligence. Induſtry</hi> is the bending of our Minds, with all our Might, to make any thing our Buſineſs; and to regard it chiefly. <hi>Seek ye firſt the Kingdom of</hi> God. We ſay, a Man doth a thing <hi>de Induſtria,</hi> when he doth it for the nonce wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h the ſettled Reſolution<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and full Purpoſe of his Heart; as <hi>Barnabas</hi> exhorted them of <hi>Antioch, To cleave unto the Lord,</hi> Act. 11.23. <hi>Set your Hearts upon all theſe Words, which I teſtify among you this Day; for it is not a vain thing,</hi> Deut. 32.46. When a Man makes it the Chief Deſign he drives at, and the Scope he aims at; and is indiff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rent about the Succeſs of other M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tters, provided this may ſucceed well.</p>
            <pb n="127" facs="tcp:107489:130"/>
            <p>This <hi>Induſtry</hi> will avoid Diverſions, will not be turned out of the way; but <hi>Seeks the way to</hi> Zion, <hi>with his Face thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therward,</hi> Jer. 50.5. As 'tis ſaid of our <hi>Lord,</hi> who had ſet His Heart upon the Work of <hi>God,</hi> to be done at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> Men might read it in His Face: Luk. 9.53. <hi>His Face was as though He would go to</hi> Jeruſalem.</p>
            <p>It will <hi>Caſt away every weight;</hi> and if it cannot, <hi>Enatare cum ſarcinis,</hi> eſcape with its Pack on its Back, will quit it readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, let it ſink or ſwim; rather than en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger Drowning with it, or for Saving of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Induſtry</hi> will Redeem the Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, brought upon it by what it could not prevent. An <hi>Induſtrious Man,</hi> if he hath been ſtaid againſt his Will, will Ride the faſter, and the later, to recover his Journeys End. An <hi>Induſtrious Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> will eke out his Day by Candle-Light, to Redeem the Time, thoſe <hi>Thieves</hi> of Time and Learning, impertinent <hi>Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,</hi> had ſtollen from him.</p>
            <p>Thus, in the Work of <hi>God;</hi> How Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent will <hi>Induſtry</hi> make a Man, when he comes to be convinc'd indeed, and ſees the Greatneſs and Concernment of his VVork? How much he is caſt behind
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:107489:131"/> by former Negligence? How Ignorant at Man's Eſtate, of what he might, and ſhould have learned, whil'ſt a Child? <hi>How far from the Kingdom of Heaven?</hi> In what danger of being be-nighted? How will he beſtir himſelf? Yea, he'll ſerve himſelf of all <hi>Occurrences,</hi> and hook in Advantages; <hi>Viam aut inveniet, aut fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciet,</hi> and will make what he cannot find, to ſ rve his great Intereſt; will Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualize, and Extract <hi>Heaven</hi> out of <hi>Earth,</hi> and preſs the very <hi>World,</hi> againſt its will, to ſerve him ſome way in the VVork of <hi>God:</hi> And the <hi>Clog</hi> which is faſtned to his Foot, to keep him down, if he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſhake it off, he'll tread upon it, and turn it to a <hi>Foot-ſtool,</hi> to lift him up, and raiſe him higher.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, <hi>Courage.</hi> The <hi>Diligent</hi> Man muſt be Valiant, or he will not long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue <hi>Diligent.</hi> The Oppoſition, and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, which croſs the way of Goodneſs, will ſpoyl his Pace, who is not arm'd with Zeal, Reſolution, and Patience. Shall that Man put to <hi>Sea,</hi> who cannot ſee the VVaves toſs or hear the VVind bluſter? They muſt be <hi>Valiant for the Truth,</hi> who will be Diligent to ſeek it, or hold it faſt. <hi>Animus, Vis, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacia,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:107489:131"/> commeatus Virtutis &amp; Faelicitatis:</hi> Courage, Hardyneſs, and Reſolution, are the Guardians and Companion of Virtue and Happineſs. The <hi>Two</hi> moſt Impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Forts againſt all Aſſaults of unkind <hi>Fortune,</hi> are <hi>Bearing</hi> and <hi>Forbearing. Fortitude</hi> will inſpirit Diligence, and blow it into Flames, and make it like Coals of <hi>Juniper,</hi> which <hi>many Waters cannot Quench.</hi> 'Twill mind him, that more fall in Flight, than Fight: And that 'tis both more Honourable, and more Safe, to ſtand our Ground, than run away.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Courage</hi> will deſpiſe Danger, and dares grapple with Difficulties; and ſcorns to uſe the Coward's Shield, <hi>(The Back)</hi> to turn it towards them. He is never like to do <hi>God</hi>'s Work to any purpoſe, that muſt ask the <hi>Devil</hi>'s Leave to do it, or the <hi>World</hi>'s either: But he muſt ſtudy to attain an Holy <hi>Greatneſs</hi> of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and True <hi>Gallantry</hi> of Mind, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves to be Good in ſpight of <hi>Satan,</hi> and all his Inſtruments. <hi>Reſiſt the Devil,</hi> (ſaith St. James) <hi>and he will fly from you,</hi> 4.7. <hi>Whom Reſiſt ſtedfaſt in the Faith,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1-5.9. <hi>Contend earneſtly for the Faith,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Jude,</hi> verſ. 3. <hi>In nothing Terrifyed,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 1.27. And again; <hi>Watch ye, ſtand faſt in the Faith,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:107489:132"/> quit you like Men, be ſtrong,</hi> 1 Cor. 16.13. Only take heed you preſume not to ſtand in your own Strength, (that's the way to fall;) But, <hi>Be ſtrong in the</hi> Lord, <hi>and in the Power of his Might: Take to your ſelves the whole Armour of</hi> God, <hi>that you may be able to ſtand againſt the Wiles of the</hi> Devil; <hi>that ye may be able to withſtand, in the Evil Day; and having done all, to ſtand,</hi> Epheſ. 6.10, 11, 13.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Courage</hi> will help your <hi>Diligence,</hi> becauſe it will enable you to venture the Expence your Work requires of you; and dare lay out in Confident Hope of an Advantageous Return. The Diligent <hi>Merchant</hi> will hazard his Goods to <hi>Sea,</hi> though ſome have met with <hi>Shipwracks</hi> in a Storm, and others have loſt all by <hi>Pyrats.</hi> The Diligent Husband-man will caſt his Seed into the Dirty Earth, though ſome hath been Buryed under the Clods, or Rotted by Inclemency of Weather: So this <hi>Courage</hi> will make thee venture bo h Coſt and Pains, and Time too, in <hi>God</hi>'s Work; and not to <hi>Serve Him, with that that coſts thee nothing;</hi> will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer thee to ſay, 'Tis a <hi>Vain thing to ſerve Him;</hi> and loſt Labour, and Unprofitable, to pray to Him: But will boldly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, <hi>In due time we ſhall Reap, if we

            <p>I now come to Conclude <hi>All,</hi> by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting you in the Emphatical Language of the <hi>Text,</hi> to work your Work, to provoke you to the utmoſt Care and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence about it.

            <p>But before I come to propound parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <hi>Motives;</hi> Let me ſuggeſt to you, which is a weighty Conſideration, That it is the General Deſign, and Scope of the whole <hi>Bible,</hi> to direct us in, or provoke us to this Work, <hi>All Scripture is given by Inſpiration of</hi> God; <hi>and is profitable, for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Inſtruction in Righteouſneſs: That the Man of</hi> God <hi>may be perfect, throughly furniſhed to every Good Work,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.16, 17.

            <p>And this will be yet more evident, if we conſider it, in the ſeveral Parts.

And I ſhall give an Inſtance or two, how every one of theſe is chiefly deſigned to be Subſervient to this End.</p>
            <p>This is the Total Sum, plac't at the Foot of the Account, when the <hi>Wiſeſt</hi> of Men had Caſt it up exactly: <hi>Let us hear the Concluſion of the whole Matter: Fear</hi> God, <hi>and keep his Commandments; for this is the Whole of Man.

            <p>As to the <hi>Promiſes;</hi> 'Tis ſaid in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, <hi>That Godlineſs hath the Promiſe of the Life that now is, and of that which is to come.</hi> And theſe <hi>Promiſes</hi> are, for Number, many: Some who have reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them up, affirm them no fewer than <hi>Six Hundred:</hi> For Na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The <hi>Hiſtories</hi> and <hi>Examples,</hi> to which I Reduce the <hi>Parables,</hi> which are ſeigned <hi>Hiſtories,</hi> the Scope of all theſe, is to ſhew God's Care of good Men, and the Pleaſure He takes in thoſe, who delight and love to do His Work with Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence: Such as <hi>Abel, Enoch,</hi> and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Patriarchs; Noah, Abraham, Iſaac, Jacob, Joſeph, Moſes, Joſhua, Caleb;</hi> and after <hi>David, Jehoſophat, Hezechias, Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah,</hi> &amp;c. with the Holy <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and <hi>Saints,</hi> Recorded in the <hi>New-Teſtament:</hi> Or His Wrath againſt Wicked Men, and the Vengeance He inflicts upon Ungodly and Unfaithful Ones; ſuch as <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Cham,</hi> and the <hi>Ten Spyes,</hi> who brought up an Evil Report on the Good Land, and diſcouraged their Brethrens Hearts from ſeeking it: ſuch as <hi>Nadab</hi> an <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hu,</hi> who offered <hi>Strange Fire;</hi> and were paid in their kind, with as <hi>Strange a Fire,</hi> which devoured them.

            <p>And, on the other ſide, let us be En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by the Happy Iſſue of Good Men's Induſtry, and Faithfulneſs, <hi>To ſhew the ſame Diligence, to the full Aſſurance of Hope unto the End:</hi> and <hi>Not to be ſloathful, but Followers of them, who through Faith and Patience, inherit the Promiſes,</hi> Heb. 6.11, 12. knowing that our Labour ſhall be no more in vain, than theirs was: But if we walk in the ſame Path, it will lead us to the ſame End; and if we mind God's Work as they did, we ſhall be Rewarded as they were.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> The <hi>Prayers</hi> Recorded in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> which make a greater Part of it, than is commonly taken Notice of,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:107489:139"/> have moſt of them a direct Aſpect upon this Work; either to beg Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for doing of it: <hi>One thing have I deſired of the</hi> Lord, <hi>That I may dwell in the Houſe of the</hi> Lord <hi>for ever, to behold His Beauty, and to enquire in His Temple. When ſhall I appear in the Preſence of</hi> God! <hi>My Soul longeth, yea even fainteth, for the Courts of the</hi> Lord: <hi>My Heart, and my Fleſh cryeth out for the Living</hi> God. <hi>A Day in thy Court, is better than a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand. I had rather be a Door-Keeper in the Houſe of my</hi> God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or for Grace and Help to do it: <hi>Teach me to do thy Will, O my</hi> God: <hi>Teach me thy Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, Incline my Heart to thy Teſtimonies. Lead me in the Way Everlaſting.</hi> Or for a gracious Acceptance of our Endeavours about it: <hi>Let my Prayer come up as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, and let the Lifting up my Hands be as a Morning-Sacrifice, Acceptable in thy Sight.</hi> Or <hi>Laſtly,</hi> For Pardon of our Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects, and the Imperfections which cleave to us, in performing of our VVork. <hi>The Good</hi> Lord <hi>pardon every one, that prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his Heart to ſeek</hi> God, <hi>the</hi> Lord God <hi>of his Fathers, though he be not Cleanſed according to the Purification of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary.</hi>

            <p>But, What need I glance at any other
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:107489:139"/> Inſtances, when of the <hi>Six Petitions</hi> of that moſt Incomparable <hi>Prayer,</hi> which our <hi>Lord</hi> Himſelf hath taught us, Five of them look directly this way.</p>
            <p>Much of our Work conſiſts in <hi>Prayer;</hi> and <hi>Prayer</hi> is to influence all the reſt of our Work: And as our <hi>Prayer</hi> muſt be Fervent, Effectual, a Working <hi>Pray<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thus you ſee, that one Principle End for which the <hi>Holy Bible</hi> was written, was to quicken and provoke us to <hi>Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence</hi> in this Work of <hi>God:</hi> Which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration alone, might, if improved as it ought, be a <hi>Spur,</hi> a <hi>Goad</hi> in our ſides, ſufficient to excite us, and might ſave the pains of adding more <hi>Motives:</hi> Yet I ſhall ſubjoyn them briefly; and with them, ſhut up this whole Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Motives</hi> to provoke our <hi>Diligence</hi> in this Work, which occur obviouſly, are ſo many, 'tis hard to couch them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Concluſion of a Diſcourſe. I ſhall propound ſome, and muſt be forced to omit and paſs by many: And though I pretend not to Exactneſs; yet to avoid
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:107489:140"/> being confuſed, I ſhall draw them from ſome diſtinct Heads.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Work</hi> calls for it; as being the beſt, Work and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, the moſt Neceſſary and requires, very Difficult and needs, yet very Poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and therefore, encourages our utmoſt <hi>Diligence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Motives</hi> to be drawn from theſe, might be made appear very Forceable; but I forbear to urge them further, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have been, in ſome Meaſure, toucht before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Diligence</hi> may allure and move us to it: As we ſay of <hi>Virtue,</hi> It is its own Reward; ſo may we ſay of <hi>Diligence,</hi> It contains Incentives to it, in it ſelf. As living Things move by an Innate Principle, as heavy Things ſink downwards by their own Weight, and the Fire aſcends by its own Lightneſs; ſo <hi>Diligence</hi> may make Men Diligent for its own ſake, it is attended with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Commendable Properties. Hear what the <hi>Scripture</hi> ſaith of it in general; <hi>The Hand of the Diligent ſhall bear Rule,</hi> Prov. 12.24. To which agrees the <hi>Greek Proverb,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>;
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:107489:140"/> All things are made its Servants. <hi>The Hand of the Diligent maketh Rich,</hi> Prov. 10.4. <hi>Diligentia factitia fortuna;</hi> Diligence is an Artificial Good Fortune. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nica Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae, &amp; Fortunae victrix;</hi> Two things are moſt hardly vanquiſht; <hi>Nature,</hi> and <hi>Ill Luck;</hi> yet <hi>Diligence</hi> will Conquer both: The Reluctances of Nature, and the croſs Accidents of Bad Fortune.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Soul of the Diligent ſhall be made Fat,</hi> Prov. 13.4. <hi>The Thoughts of the Diligent tend only to Plenteouſneſs,</hi> Prov. 21.5. <hi>Seeſt thou a Man Diligent in his Buſineſs? he ſhall ſtand before Kings, he ſhall not ſtand before Mean Men,</hi> Prov. 22.29.</p>
            <p>In particular, There are <hi>Three Motives</hi> to be drawn from the Excellency of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,</hi> to make us fall in Love with it, and to excite us to it; <hi>viz.</hi> the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of what it is, 1. To our ſelves. 2. To others. 3. To <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Be Diligent in this Work; for it will be very <hi>Comfortable,</hi> it will yield you the ſweeteſt Peace of Conſcience. There is nothing under Heaven, a Man had need be ſo careful to pleaſe, as his own <hi>Conſcience;</hi> or that he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, and ſtand in ſo great awe of. Now, the Man who loves the Peace, or is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:107489:141"/> of the Diſquiet of his own <hi>Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> had need be <hi>Diligent.</hi> Hear what St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of it; 2 Cor. 1.12. <hi>This is our Rejoycing, the Teſtimony of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, That in Simplicity, and Godly Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, we have had our Converſation in this World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And let me tell you, <hi>Diligence</hi> and <hi>Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,</hi> in the Work of <hi>God,</hi> is the only Thing, upon which Peace and inward Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort do depend, and from which it ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth. Oh, the ſweet Reflections that follow the Remembrance of it!

            <p>Duty and <hi>Diligence,</hi> that's our part; Succeſs, and to give Attainment, that's <hi>God</hi>'s part. And 'tis the <hi>Conſcience</hi> of diſcharged Duty, which yields us Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; If it were poſſible for ſuch an one to go to Hell, it would mitigate and eaſe the moſt ſtinging part of his Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

               <hi>Labour</hi> gets the beſt <hi>Stomach,</hi> and a good <hi>Stomach</hi> is the beſt Sawce; and ſo a good <hi>Conſcience</hi> is the beſt Feaſt. That Bread is ſweeteſt, which we Earn. <hi>Jus dat Labor:</hi> Such Bread is not Gritty; we Eat it without Regret.</p>
            <p>As a <hi>Miniſter,</hi> who thruſts himſelf into that <hi>Office,</hi> as a Trade to get Money, as a Means to relieve a Broken Fortune, as a Ladder to climb the Pinacle of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; and neither deſigns the Glory of <hi>God,</hi> nor Good of Souls: If this Man ſhould by chance Convert a Sinner, it would yield him no Comfort, becauſe his Heart tells him, He neither deſign'd it, nor deſir'd it. So if another, whoſe Soul is ſet to ſave them who hear him; yet plough upon the Rock, and ſee not the deſired Succeſs upon Men; yet ſhall he aſſuredly find it with <hi>God.

            <p>And <hi>Diligence</hi> is as <hi>Honourable,</hi> as <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable:</hi> Nothing reflects a greater Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry upon a Man, than <hi>Sedulity.</hi> And thoſe who are too Lazy to imitate him, will yet either Admire, or Envy him; and to be Envyed is as Honourable, as to be En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious is Baſe.</p>

            <p>Be <hi>Diligent</hi> therefore in this Work of <hi>God,</hi> that thou may'ſt make others ſo: And beſides the Benefit which they ſhall reap, it will redound to thy Advantage.

            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> But all that our <hi>Diligence</hi> can be, either to our ſelves or others, is as
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:107489:143"/> nothing, in <hi>Compariſon</hi> to what it is in <hi>God</hi>'s Account. For though, next to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <hi>God,</hi> 'tis very conſiderable what In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence it may have upon our own Good, or the Good of others; yet our main <hi>Intereſt</hi> is, and our Buſineſs ought to be, to pleaſe Him; according to that of the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.9. <hi>We labour</hi> (or are <hi>Ambitious,</hi> as the <hi>Original</hi> Word ſignifies) <hi>that we may be Accepted of Him; becauſe we muſt all appear before the Judgment-Seat of</hi> Chriſt; <hi>that every one may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Things done in His Body, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that he hath done, whether it be Good or Bad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, God eſteems our <hi>Diligence,</hi> and Faithfulneſs in His Work and Service, to be our <hi>honouring</hi> and <hi>glorifying</hi> Him; as is implyed in that Place; <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.30. <hi>Him that Honoureth me,</hi> that is, <hi>Serves me Diligently;</hi> which <hi>Eli</hi>'s Sons had negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; and by that Neglect, were accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to deſpiſe Him: So, <hi>This People ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureth me with their Lips,</hi> Matth. 15.8. which was indeed, but a <hi>Mock-Honour,</hi> becauſe it was no more; but had been <hi>Real Honour,</hi> if it had proceeded from their Hearts.

               <hi>Sloath</hi> may do a little; but 'tis <hi>Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,</hi> which doth much. And it <hi>Honours</hi> Him many wayes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> His <hi>Authority.</hi> 'Tis the <hi>Honour</hi> of a <hi>Lord</hi> or <hi>Maſter,</hi> to have his Servants exactly <hi>Obedient,</hi> and <hi>Obſervant</hi> of his Will; to go when he bids them, come when he calls them, and do what he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns them readily, and with all their Power; as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> promiſed to <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua,</hi> Chap. 1.16, 17, 18. which was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for his <hi>Honour:</hi> So our <hi>Diligence</hi> in God's Work, gives Him the <hi>Honour</hi> of being a Wiſe, a Righteous, a Gracious, an All-ſufficient, a Faithful GOD; Fit to Rule us, Able to Protect us, Careful to Reward us; and in all, makes His <hi>Praiſe glorious.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>Secondly, <hi>Negligence</hi> in <hi>God</hi>'s Work, caſts a great Damp upon others, weakens their Hands, &amp; diſcourageth their Hearts: The World is exceeding prone to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

            <p>Now when Men, who are too ready of themſelves to be Slack and Remiſs in theſe Matters, ſee you, who are their Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Sleight and Sloathful; How will they argue from, and improve ſo bad a Precedent? and ſay to themſelves, 'Tis ſafe to do ſo; as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> argues in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Caſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.10. <hi>Shall not the Conſcience of him that is weak, be embold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned?</hi> So may I in this; Shall not others be <hi>imboldned</hi> to be as Careleſs as thy ſelf? <hi>And ſo thou wilt deſtroy thy Brother, for whom</hi> Chriſt <hi>Dyed:</hi> And ſin againſt his Soul, and ſin againſt <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and againſt thy own Life, all at once.</p>
            <p>And I appeal to your own Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, What is it that makes <hi>Forwardneſs</hi> and <hi>Zeal</hi> in Religion, and <hi>Diligence</hi> in <hi>God</hi>'s Work, be look't upon with ſo ſhy and ſuſpicious an Eye in moſt places?

            <p>If it be ſo dangerous to be Partaker of other Mens Sins, What is it to be the <hi>Author</hi> of other Men's Sins!

            <p>And ſo, for the Things of the <hi>World:</hi> No Study or Contrivance of the Head, no Labour nor Travel of the Hands or Feet, is thought too much: How did <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> Serve for <hi>Rachel?</hi> See how he deſcribes his <hi>Diligence,</hi> Gen. 31.40. <hi>In the Day the Drought conſumed me, and the Froſt by Night; and my Sleep departed from mine-Eyes.</hi> And 'tis eaſier to find an <hi>Hundred</hi> following him in this, than <hi>Two</hi> or <hi>Three</hi> in his Wreſtling with God, and not letting <hi>Him</hi> go till they obtain the Bleſſing: Moſt Men being ſerious about Trifles, and only trifling and dallying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

<pb n="172" facs="tcp:107489:153"/> Happineſs depends upon it; and 'tis our <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> if we will thus work. A word of every one of theſe, may ſerve.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> 'Tis our <hi>Duty,</hi> and we are bound by His <hi>Authority,</hi> who is our <hi>Lord. He hath commanded us to keep His Precepts di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently. The Firſt and Great Command, is, To Love the Lord our</hi> God, (which is the very Soul and Life of this Work) <hi>with all our Heart, and all our Soul; with all our Might, and all our Strength.</hi> Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Step in this Way, muſt be trodden heedfully: <hi>See that ye Walk circumſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; not as Fools, but as Wiſe:</hi> Not at Peradventure. <hi>Keep thy Heart with all Diligence,</hi> Prov. 4.24. <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s Words are very preſſing, Chap. 22.5. <hi>Take di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent heed to do the Commandment, and the Law which</hi> Moſes <hi>the Servant of the</hi> Lord <hi>charged you, to Love the Lord your</hi> God, <hi>and to Walk in all His Wayes, and to Keep His Commandments, and to Cleave to Him, and to Serve Him with all your Heart, and all your Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As we muſt <hi>agree quickly with our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary;</hi> ſo we muſt <hi>give Diligence to be delivered from him.</hi> We muſt not only <hi>Work at,</hi> but <hi>Work out our own Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> As we muſt <hi>Receive the Word with all readineſs;</hi> ſo we muſt take moſt <hi>Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:107489:153"/> heed to the Things we have heard; leſt at any time we let them ſlip,</hi> Heb. 2.1. We muſt be <hi>Zealous, and Repent:</hi> We muſt <hi>Believe</hi> with all our Hearts: We muſt <hi>Love Chriſt</hi> in Sincerity: We muſt <hi>Obey from the Heart the Form of Doctrine delivered to us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a word; We muſt do all <hi>God</hi>'s Work, as in His Sight, remembering He ſtands by, and looks on; and, as near as may be, as the <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> do in Heaven: And to be ſure, that is <hi>Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently</hi> indeed. 'Tis our <hi>Duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> We are bound by <hi>Gratitude</hi> and <hi>Ingenuity;</hi> which Bond, like Silken ones, ſhould be the Stronger for its Soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. If a <hi>Friend</hi> lend Money, or a <hi>Stock</hi> to <hi>Trade</hi> with, which he that wanteth cannot Trade at all; this is a great <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement</hi> upon thoſe who Receive it, to Trade the more <hi>Induſtriouſly.</hi> Thus <hi>God</hi> hath dealt with us; hath Truſted us with <hi>Talents,</hi> and with <hi>Opportunities,</hi> and expects the beſt <hi>Improvement</hi> of them <hi>Why is there a Price put in the Hand of a Fool, to get Wiſdom, ſeeing he hath no Heart there-to,</hi> Prov. 17.16?</p>
            <p>When <hi>God</hi> ſets up His <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> 'tis to this End, That Men may ſeek him in it, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.16, 17. The Kindneſs of that
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:107489:154"/> 
               <hi>Benefactor</hi> is abuſed baſely, who furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him with Tools, who will not uſe them.</p>
            <p>Leave, Opportunity, Help to do our Work, is as great an <hi>Obligation,</hi> as can be laid on any Ingenuous Man, to make him <hi>Diligent.</hi> How oft doth <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſay, <hi>He that hath Ears to Hear, let him Hear,</hi> Luk. 8.8, 10. As we commonly ask, <hi>What did</hi> God <hi>give you Eyes, and Ears, and Hands for; but to See, and Hear, and Work?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We are bound by <hi>Intereſt,</hi> and 'tis our <hi>Wiſdom</hi> to Promote this Work; for the <hi>Advantage</hi> redounds to our ſelves. <hi>If thou be Wiſe, thou ſhalt be Wiſe for thy ſelf; and if thou Scorneſt, thou alone ſhalt bear it,</hi> Prov. 9.12. <hi>God</hi> ſets us not to Work, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> to Make <hi>Brick</hi> for his Buildings: But we work for our ſelves, though He ſets us our Work; and we ſhall <hi>Suffer Loſs, if our Work abide not. Bleſſed is the Man that heareth Me, watching daily at My Gates, waiting at the Poſts of My Doors: For whoſo findeth Me, findeth Life, and ſhall obtain Favour of the</hi> Lord. <hi>But he that ſinneth againſt Me, wrongeth his own Soul; all they that hate Me, love Death,</hi> Prov. 7.34, 35, 36.</p>
            <pb n="175" facs="tcp:107489:154"/>
            <p>Men are greatly <hi>Ambitious,</hi> to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted <hi>Wiſe;</hi> and 'tis the Greateſt <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> to be <hi>Wiſe</hi> to Salvation: And ſo is that Man, who underſtands his own <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt</hi> ſo well, as to do his <hi>Work</hi> with <hi>Diligence.</hi> Do it therefore ſo, and it <hi>Shall be thy Wiſdom and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> Deut. 4.6.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Laſt Head,</hi> from which I ſhall draw <hi>Motives</hi> to excite your <hi>Diligence,</hi> is <hi>Example;</hi> Than which, none can be more fit and proper, in this Subject: Man is naturally prone to be led by <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,</hi> eſpecially in Working; and the Principal Force of the <hi>Text,</hi> depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s urging our Duty by His own <hi>Example; I muſt work the Works of Him that ſent Me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, we have great Variety and Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of <hi>Examples,</hi> to draw us, yea pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke us unto <hi>Diligence;</hi> no leſs than the whole <hi>Creation;</hi> nay more: For all the <hi>Creatures,</hi> and the <hi>Creatour</hi> Himſelf, are our <hi>Examples</hi> herein. <hi>God</hi> Himſelf is <hi>Purus Actus,</hi> as the <hi>Schools</hi> call Him; a <hi>Spirit,</hi> an Active, Quickening Spirit; all Life, Activity, and Motion; who is E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally Buſie, never Idle, Unimploy'd, or Acting Wearily or Faintly. <hi>My Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:107489:155"/> hitherto Worketh, and I Work,</hi> ſaith our <hi>Lord.</hi> And the whole <hi>Creation,</hi> like its <hi>Maker,</hi> had naturally na Sloathful Piece, 'till <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Vice</hi> had taught them to be ſuch; and even ſince, the Worſt are <hi>Buſie</hi> in their Wickedneſs, and <hi>Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent</hi> in doing Miſchief; which ſhould <hi>Shame</hi> us, and <hi>Provoke</hi> us, to out-do them in our Better Work.</p>
            <p>But I'le briefly touch this <hi>Argument</hi> by Parts. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The <hi>Inanimate Creatures.</hi> What <hi>David</hi> calls upon them to do, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148. they do moſt <hi>Diligently;</hi> Obey the <hi>Law</hi> of their <hi>Creation,</hi> Fulfil their Maker's Will, and Do the <hi>Work</hi> He made them for. The <hi>Sun,</hi> the <hi>Moon,</hi> and <hi>Stars,</hi> and all the <hi>Hoſt</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> give both their <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Influence;</hi> move Swiftly, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly, and Conſtantly; meaſure to us <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Seaſons,</hi> by their Equal <hi>Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions;</hi> and never ſtop, unleſs He bids them; and yet one Word of His, <hi>checks</hi> them in their full Career; and they <hi>Stand,</hi> or <hi>go Back,</hi> as He commands them. The <hi>Wind,</hi> the <hi>Rain,</hi> the <hi>Hail,</hi> the <hi>Snow,</hi> the <hi>Storms</hi> and <hi>Tempeſts,</hi> and the <hi>Meteors</hi> do the like. The <hi>Sea</hi> Ebbs and Flows, raiſes its Billows, or ſmooths its Face at His leaſt Beck. The <hi>Earth</hi> gives forth
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:107489:155"/> its Strength, for <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Beaſts;</hi> reſts, and is quiet, or Quakes and Trembles at His Word; yea, Cleaves aſunder under thoſe He bids it ſwallow down. The <hi>Trees</hi> bring for their <hi>Fruit,</hi> or caſt their <hi>Leaves,</hi> at His Appointment; and know their <hi>Spring</hi> and <hi>Autumn.</hi> And all the <hi>Bruit Creatures</hi> are Strangers to <hi>Sloath,</hi> and Enemies to <hi>Diſobedience;</hi> but Patterns of <hi>Diligence</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom.</hi> The <hi>Ant,</hi> the <hi>Turtle,</hi> the <hi>Crane,</hi> and the <hi>Swallow,</hi> keep their <hi>Seaſons,</hi> and do their <hi>Work</hi> in them; and the Stolid <hi>Ox,</hi> and Stupid <hi>Aſs,</hi> know their Owner, and their <hi>Maſter</hi>'s <hi>Crib;</hi> and will wear His Yoke, who Feeds them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Devil</hi> and <hi>Wicked Men:</hi> For, <hi>Fas eſt ab hoſte Doceri:</hi> Satan <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes the Earth, and walks about in it, goes about continually ſeeking whom he may devour;</hi> is alwayes contriving <hi>Miſchief</hi> by his Wiles, Depths, Methods, Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems; or acting it by Temptations, which he multiplyes one after another, that if one ſucceed not, another may; as he did with our <hi>Lord</hi> Himſelf, for <hi>Forty Dayes</hi> together. <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> the God of <hi>Flyes,</hi> is more importunate than any <hi>Fly, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to winnow, even the Diſciples, as Wheat is winnowed:</hi> To ſift Men to the <hi>Bran;</hi>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:107489:156"/> a <hi>Phraſe</hi> importing utmoſt <hi>Diligence:</hi> Alwayes reſtleſs, never weary; and gives not over till Reſtrain'd, and Chain'd up by a ſtrong Hand. And <hi>Wicked Men</hi> are like him: <hi>They accompliſh a Diligent Search, they weary themſelves to commit Iniquity;</hi> and <hi>cannot Sleep, unleſs they cauſe ſome to fall. Commit their Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes with both Hands greedily:</hi> And take more pains to go to <hi>Hell,</hi> than would ſuffice, if well imploy'd, to bring them to <hi>Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Oh! What a <hi>Shame</hi> is it, that <hi>Satan</hi>'s Envy againſt <hi>God,</hi> and Malice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Man, ſhould make him more <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent</hi> in his Work; than our <hi>Zeal</hi> for <hi>God</hi>'s Glory, and Love to our own Souls, can make us in the <hi>Work</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> for our own <hi>Salvation!</hi> And, What pity is it, that ſo bad a Maſter as wicked Men ſerve, ſhould be ſerved with more Vigor, Induſtry, and Life, than the <hi>Lord of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> whom we pretend to ſerve, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs we believe to be the Beſt of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> in <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> They <hi>Ceaſe not Day or Night, to give Glory to Him that ſits upon the Throne; crying Holy, Holy, Holy!</hi> The <hi>Cherubims,</hi> in <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Viſion, were repreſented by
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:107489:156"/> 
               <hi>Wheels;</hi> and there, and alwayes, having <hi>Wings,</hi> both <hi>Emblems</hi> of <hi>Velocity,</hi> and Speedy <hi>Diligence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, as they be ſet for our <hi>Patterns</hi> in the <hi>Lord</hi>'s-<hi>Prayer,</hi> while we are taught to pray for Grace, <hi>To do</hi> God's <hi>Will on Earth, as it is done in Heaven,</hi> we either ask we know not what, or we do but mock <hi>God,</hi> if we endeavour not to <hi>Serve</hi> Him with the ſame <hi>Diligence,</hi> as near as we can attain it; where with the <hi>Hoſt</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> ſerve Him conſtantly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> The <hi>Example</hi> of <hi>God</hi> Himſelf, Bleſſed for ever, whom we are ſo oft required to imitate: <hi>Be ye Holy, for I am Holy: Be ye Perfect, as your Father in Heaven is Perfect.</hi> This beyond all, ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain us to ſhew forth our utmoſt <hi>Diligence.</hi> Shall <hi>God</hi> be ſo Sollicitous to promote our <hi>Salvation?</hi> and, Shall we ſleight and deſpiſe it, as if it were not worth Regarding? <hi>God</hi> the Father, imploy'd His Bleſſed Thoughts about it, from all <hi>Eternity;</hi> deviſing Means <hi>to bring home His Baniſhed,</hi> that they ſhould not be <hi>Expelled</hi> from Himſelf; to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile His <hi>Mercy,</hi> and His <hi>Juſtice;</hi> to Puniſh the <hi>Sin,</hi> and Spare the <hi>Sinner; and made all his Glory paſs before Him,</hi> in the Accompliſhment of it; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play'd all His <hi>Attributes,</hi> in their brighteſt <hi>Luſtre;</hi> and, in a word, gave His Son, the Dearly Beloved of His Soul, <hi>in whom He took</hi> Infinite and Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>pleaſure,</hi> to be made a <hi>Man,</hi> and then to be made a <hi>Curſe.</hi> And <hi>God</hi> (the <hi>Son</hi>) came down from <hi>Heaven,</hi> for us Men, and for our <hi>Salvation.</hi> And having done ſo, ſpent His time in the <hi>World,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:107489:157"/> to the Ends for which He came into it; which was to <hi>Glorify</hi> His Father, do His Will, and do Good to the Souls and Bodies of Men: and He did it all with a <hi>Zeal, that even Conſumed and Eat Him up;</hi> and made the Fooliſh World ſay, He was <hi>Mad,</hi> or <hi>Beſides</hi> Himſelf; as they are ready to do of all that follow Him. And at laſt, after a <hi>Life</hi> ſpent in <hi>preaching</hi> whole Dayes, and <hi>praying</hi> whole Nights, and Working mighty <hi>Miracles;</hi> He Finiſh't all with a <hi>Willing Obedience</hi> to the moſt <hi>painful, ſhameful,</hi> and <hi>accurſed Death;</hi> and even now He is in <hi>Heaven,</hi> He is as <hi>Diligent</hi> as ever, making <hi>Interceſſion</hi> without <hi>Intermiſſion;</hi> and watching and ordering all things for the Good of thoſe, who ſhall be <hi>Heirs</hi> of <hi>Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the moſt Holy, and moſt Bleſſed <hi>Spirit,</hi> is as <hi>buſie</hi> and <hi>ſedulous,</hi> as either of the Former; knocking, calling, ſtriving, warning, wooing Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, to return to <hi>God,</hi> to be ſo Wiſe as to be contented to be Happy upon <hi>God</hi>'s Terms; which, in one word are, That you <hi>Work out your Salvation with Fear and Trembling;</hi> and improve your <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> with meet <hi>Diligence,</hi> while you have them: <hi>Working while 'tis Day, before that Night over-take you, in which no Man can Work:</hi> Which, that we all do, The Good <hi>Lord</hi> vouchſafe us that Grace and Wiſdom, which may Aſſiſt us, and Direct us, to do accordingly. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>AS time is meaſured out to us, by the revolution of days, and months, and years; ſo is Gods <hi>patience</hi> magnified towards us, by multiplying the returns of them. And as his <hi>Patience</hi> is
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:107489:158"/> magnified, ſo is our <hi>Account</hi> increaſed, and <hi>Impenitency</hi> aggravated according to the number of the portions of <hi>time</hi> which paſs over us: and the more we have waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſent home empty to him, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected fruit from us in them all, the more we have cauſe to expect and fear that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry next, and new one, ſhould be our laſt: for God will not always bear the <hi>diſappointment</hi> of his expectation, but <hi>tho he bear long,</hi> will not forbear always, but will at length <hi>curſe</hi> to a with'ring, or cut down for burning, the barren Tree, which bears either none, or no good Fruit, year after year. This conſideration hath induced mee, in the beginning of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther year, to chuſe this <hi>Parable</hi> to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of, to preſs you with all the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs I can, after ſo many years, of provoking unfruitfulneſs, to tempt Gods <hi>long-ſuffering</hi> no longer, by impenitency and barrenneſs under the Goſpel, leſt if being let alone this year alſo, you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue only incumbrances of Gods <hi>Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard:</hi> He continue no longer to ſpare you, nor Chriſt to interceed for you, that you may be ſpared, nor good men be able to prevail for you, nor your own <hi>Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences</hi> have any <hi>plea</hi> left; but that ye be cut off, without pitty on Gods part, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:107489:158"/> remedy on mans, and without excuſe on you own.</p>
            <p>There is not a place in all the Holy <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,</hi> wherein <hi>Repentance,</hi> and that both ſound and ſpeedy, is more vehemently urged, and more emphatically enforced than the beginning of this <hi>Chapter.</hi> For as thoſe who heard our <hi>Lord</hi> urge the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of the <hi>Creditor</hi> and <hi>Debtor,</hi> (laid down in the two laſt <hi>verſes</hi> of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding <hi>Chapter,</hi>) againſt <hi>procraſtination;</hi> may ſeem to have taken occaſion thence, to tell him the ſtory of the <hi>Galileans, Whoſe blood</hi> Pilate <hi>had mingled with their Sacirfices;</hi> ſo our <hi>Lord</hi> takes occaſion fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to improve that his <hi>Doctrine</hi> againſt neglect and deferring <hi>Repentance</hi> by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying that <hi>ſtory</hi> now told him, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>eighteen men on whom the Tower of</hi> Siloam <hi>had fallen</hi> and deſtroyed them: which were both true and real <hi>Stories,</hi> of things which had actually, and lately hapned: and were freſh in all mens me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories and mouths.</p>
            <p>Now theſe being very awakning <hi>exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> and ſtartling inſtances of ſudden and ſurprizing <hi>Judgments.</hi> Our <hi>Saviour</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his great wiſdom and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, will not let ſlip ſo fair an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to preſs his hearers from them, to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:107489:159"/> ſpeedy and ſincere <hi>Repentance.</hi> As if he had <hi>ſaid,</hi> theſe were not greater, not more flagitious ſinners, than their Neighbours, no, nor then your ſelves: and yet theſe things, you hear and know, hapned unto them, and as bad, or worſe, may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen unto you, nay will, unleſs you <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent:</hi> and now eſpecially, ſince God hath given them to be ſuch warnings to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken you; <hi>If you do not now repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh.</hi> Your impenitency, aggravated by ſlighting ſuch an alarum as their fall gives you; will provoke God to meet with you ſome way or other; and if in any caſe he cut you off before you have <hi>Repented</hi> truly, you periſh unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and that for ever.</p>
            <p>Little did the <hi>Galileans</hi> think, when they went to offer <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> they ſhould themſelves be made a <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> Little did the <hi>Eighteen men</hi> who were in or nigh the <hi>Tower of</hi> Siloam, well and ſafe, and ſecure from fear, think to be cruſht to death in a moment, in the twinkling of an Eye, and yet theſe things befel them both.</p>
            <p>And ſo may it be with any of you: when you are at <hi>Church,</hi> when you are bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie in the Streets, when you are ſafe and merry in your Houſes, ſome unthought of, ſome unſuſpected calamity, may ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:107489:159"/> ſurprize: therefore <hi>Repent</hi> ſpeedily that you may be always <hi>ready,</hi> for all <hi>events,</hi> and to meet what ever Meſſage Gods Providence may ſend.</p>
            <p>But of ſuch importance is this duty, and ſo earneſt is our <hi>Lord</hi> to faſten this <hi>nail</hi> ſurely, that he reiterates his ſtroaks to drive it home, and therefore adds this <hi>Parable,</hi> after the wiſe Application and improvement he had made of two real <hi>ſtories</hi> ſo appoſite to his purpoſe. And this is <hi>Hiſtoria ficta,</hi> though not a real Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of things actually done, yet a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of things uſual, and likely to be done: which ſtrikes the <hi>Phanſie,</hi> and by that the <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Conſcience,</hi> with a quicker and more ſmart ſtroak, than what is delivered in plain thoſe moſt expreſſive and ſignificant words.</p>
            <p>Methinks upon the reading of this <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi> of the <hi>Fig-tree,</hi> we may cry out as the <hi>Holy Apoſtle,</hi> doth upon the writing the like <hi>Parable</hi> of the <hi>Olive-tree, Rom,</hi> xi. 22. <hi>Behold the goodneſs and ſeverity of God:</hi> but with this two-fold difference.</p>
            <p>Firſt, There they were both execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, here Mercy and Goodneſs only is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed, Juſtice and Severity only threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:107489:160"/>
            <p>Secondly, There they are imployed upon ſeveral Subjects, or perſons: Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs on the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> Severity on the <hi>Jews:</hi> here both are converſant about the ſame object.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Behold his <hi>Goodneſs</hi> in ſeveral reſpects. 1. 'Tis great Mercy to be Planted ſo advantageouſly in the <hi>Vineyard,</hi> in ſo Fat and well prepared a Soyl: and ſo well Fenc'd and ſecured from annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, both of Beaſts and Weather, by an Hedg and by a Wall. 2. 'Tis Mercy to be forborn ſo long, and ſuffered to ſtand year after year, notwithſtanding its un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfulneſs. 3. 'Tis Mercy to have the <hi>Interceſſion</hi> of the Dreſſer of the <hi>Vineyard,</hi> and to have that Interceſſion prevalent and accepted for it; and thereupon to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it more time, and more pains and coſt to be beſtowed upon it, in <hi>digging</hi> and <hi>dreſſing</hi> and <hi>dunging</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, behold his <hi>Juſtice</hi> too. 1. 'Tis juſt with God to expect <hi>Fruit</hi> of a <hi>Tree</hi> ſo Planted, to come with expectation of it, to call it to accompt, and take ſevere no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of its unfruitfulneſs. 2. 'Tis juſt to upbraid it and reproach it, for <hi>Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the ground,</hi> and to paſs Sentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, to <hi>cut it down,</hi> for ſo long and ſo often diſappointing of his deſires.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:107489:160"/> 3. 'Tis juſt to proceed to actual cutting down without remedy or pity, after more pains and coſt beſtowed upon it in vain, and to no purpoſe.</p>
            <p>We cannot have a better <hi>Commentary</hi> upon this <hi>Text</hi> than the ſeven firſt <hi>Verſes</hi> of the fifth <hi>Chapter</hi> of <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tranſcribe them. <hi>Now will I ſing to my well beloved a Song of my beloved, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his vineyard: my well beloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill. And he fenced it, and gathered out the ſtones there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and planted it with the choyeſt Vine, and built a tower in the midſt of it, and alſo made a wine preſs therein: and he looked that it ſhould bring forth Grapes; and it brought forth wild Grapes. And now O inhabitants of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and men of</hi> Judah, <hi>judg I pray you betwixt me and my Vineyard. What could have been done more to my Vineyard, that I have not done in it? Wherefore when I looked for Grapes, brought it forth wild Grapes? And now go to, I will tell you what I will do to my Vineyard, I will take away the hedg thereof, and it ſhall be eaten up: and break down the Wall, and it ſhall be trodden down. And I will lay it waſt, it ſhall not be pruned nor digged: but there ſhall come up briars and thorns, I will alſo command the Clouds that they Rain no Rain
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:107489:161"/> upon it. For the Vineyard of the Lord of Hoſts is the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and the men of</hi> Judah <hi>his pleaſant Plant: and he looked for Judgment, but behold oppreſſion, and for Righteouſneſs, but behold a cry.</hi> I ſhall leave it to your ſelves to make the <hi>Paralel,</hi> and ſuch obſervations, as may help you by one, to underſtand the other. And I will now proceed to the eaſieſt and plaineſt explication of the <hi>Parable</hi> that poſſibly I can. And let us divide it into its parts, that they may be explained in the better order. Of the <hi>four verſes</hi> of which it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, the two former, ſix and ſeven, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the <hi>Lord</hi> of the <hi>Vineyard:</hi> and the two latter, eight and nine, belong to the <hi>Dreſſer</hi> of the <hi>Vineyard,</hi> of thoſe two which relate to the <hi>Lord</hi> of the <hi>Vineyard,</hi> the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer tells you what he did, the latter what he ſaid. Of the two which relate to the <hi>Dreſſer</hi> of the <hi>Vineyard,</hi> the former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains his Interceſſion that it may be ſpared: the latter his Conceſſion that it ſhould be deſtroyed, upon ſuppoſition of its continuing unfruitful.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now explain them in this order I have named them, and all as conciſely as I may, and with reſpect to the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which I chiefly intend.</p>
            <p>In the ſixth we have four things to be
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:107489:161"/> opened. 1. Who this <hi>Lord</hi> of the <hi>Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard</hi> is, and the three things he did. 1. Had a <hi>Fig-tree</hi> Planted in his <hi>Vineyard.</hi> 2. Came to ſeek <hi>Fruit</hi> of it. 3. Found none. Firſt the certain man, the <hi>Lord</hi> of the <hi>Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard</hi> is the Lord <hi>Jehovah,</hi> the great God poſſeſſor of Heaven and Earth, as appears by <hi>Iſ.</hi> v. 7. before named, <hi>Pſ.</hi> lxxx. from the ſeven to the ſixteenth very fully, and by St. <hi>Matth.</hi> xx. 1. and xxi. 33, 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. The <hi>Vineyard</hi> is, in the primary intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Parable,</hi> the <hi>Synagogue,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which God had plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ſo much, love and care, as is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the forenamed <hi>Pſalm</hi> lxxx. 7, 8. But by juſt <hi>Analogy</hi> and proportion, is the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> of God under the Goſpel. And any particular <hi>Church,</hi> in any Nation, to which God doth vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe his <hi>Goſpel,</hi> Word and Ordinances.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fig-tree</hi> planted in this <hi>Vineyard,</hi> is any particular <hi>Church,</hi> with reſpect to the <hi>Catholick</hi> or Univerſal <hi>Church,</hi> of which it is a Part or Member. Or any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſon, man or woman, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to that particular <hi>Church,</hi> in which he lives, and partakes of Chriſts Inſtitutions.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fig-tree</hi> is a Tree of- a Fruit-bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kind, Naturally apt to bring forth, ſweet and good Fruit, <hi>Judg.</hi> ix. 11. not
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:107489:162"/> barren by Nature, like an <hi>Aſp,</hi> or <hi>Elm</hi> or <hi>Willow:</hi> nor bad Fruit as the <hi>Thorn,</hi> of which men expect not to gather ſweet Fruit, <hi>Luke</hi> vi. 44. <hi>Of thorns men do not gather figs.</hi> So man endued with Reaſon, Conſcience, Will, Affections, is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to know, chuſe, love, fear, ſerve God, and obey him.</p>
            <p>Now that it may not ſeem incongruous, to ſpeak of a <hi>Fig-tree</hi> (which is a Plant of another kind) in a <hi>Vineyard.</hi> You muſt know: though the Vine Plants, as being moſt, gave denomination, (as <hi>Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio eſt à potiori</hi>) Yet it was uſual with them, both to ſow Corn in <hi>Vineyards</hi> betwixt their Vines. <hi>Deut.</hi> xxii. 9. <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſow thy Vineyard with divers ſeeds:</hi> And alſo to plant Trees of another kind, partly to ſupport their <hi>Vines,</hi> which are a weak and tender Plant, and partly to make the better improvement of their Ground: and none more commonly than <hi>Fig trees.</hi> Which makes it ſo frequent to name them together, <hi>ſit every man under his Vine, and under his Fig-tree.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The planting this <hi>Fig-tree</hi> in the <hi>Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,</hi> ſignifies the <hi>calling</hi> any Nation to the knowledg, and profeſſion of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and making them a <hi>Church,</hi> as a part of the Univerſal <hi>Church:</hi> or it is the receiving
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:107489:162"/> a man or woman into the <hi>Church</hi> by <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</hi> See the expreſſion in the very Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Rom.</hi> vi. 3, 4, 5. <hi>Know ye not that as many of us as were Baptiſed into Jeſus Chriſt were Baptiſed into his death, and if we have been planted together in the likeneſs of his death,</hi> &amp;c. So that he uſeth the Phraſes of being <hi>Baptiſed,</hi> and <hi>Planted,</hi> as ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the ſame, or explaining one the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So that every one of you who have been <hi>Baptiſed,</hi> are thereby <hi>Planted</hi> in Gods <hi>Vineyard:</hi> admitted to partake of the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances</hi> and <hi>Priviledges</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel-Church,</hi> and thereby obliged to the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Conſequent upon thoſe Priviledges. As a Tree which ſtands in the Orchard is bound (as I may ſay) to bear part of that Fruit, which the Maſter and Owner of the Orchard looks for.</p>
            <p>His coming to look for Fruit, is a moſt obvious Alluſion, to the cuſtom amongſt men, to go into their <hi>Gardens,</hi> and <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards,</hi> to fee what Fruit the Trees bear, or whether they bear any, which they have cauſed to be ſet in them. <hi>Cant.</hi> vii. 12. <hi>Let us go early into the Vineyards, let us ſee if the Vine flouriſh, whether the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Grapes appear, and the Pomegranates put forth.</hi> And is the ſame with <hi>Iſa.</hi> v. 2. where God ſaith, <hi>He lookt for Grapes,</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:107489:163"/> which <hi>verſe</hi> 7. he interprets, <hi>He lookt for judgment and righteouſneſs,</hi> and which he ſpeaks in plain words, without any <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Pſal.</hi> xiv. 2. <hi>The Lord lookt down from Heaven upon the children of men, to ſee if there were any that did underſtand and ſeek God,</hi> and is equivalent to what is expreſt by another ſence, <hi>viz.</hi> of hearing. <hi>Jer.</hi> viii. 6. <hi>I hearkned and heard but they ſpake not aright, no man repented of the evil of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſaying what have I done:</hi> and might, were it needful, be illuſtrated by many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Scriptures.</hi> In a word, it is as much as if it were ſaid, God comes to look after every man, whether they fulfil their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Chriſtianity, which they made with him when they were <hi>Baptiſed,</hi> and planted in his Church.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, His finding no Fruit, is Gods diſappointment; as to what he greatly deſires, looks for, yea even longs for. No true <hi>Repentance,</hi> no ſound <hi>Faith,</hi> no ſincere <hi>Obedience,</hi> no Reformation of Life, no hearty turning unto God, no Holineſs and Righteouſneſs, no ſerious care, nor vigorous Zeal to glorifie God, and ſave their own ſouls, or as it is, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> iv. 1. <hi>No truth, no mercy, no knowledg of God in the land, but ſwearing, lying, killing, ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, committing adultery, and breaking out
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:107489:163"/> till blood toucheth blood,</hi> and no man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth one another for theſe evils, but are ready to ſtrive with the <hi>Prieſt</hi> if he reprove them for them, <hi>verſe</hi> 2, 4. Such rotten and vile <hi>Figs</hi> are all the Fruit they bear, or at beſt, a few leaves of empty Profeſſion, and ſome cheap formal du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and lip labour, and drawing near to God with the body, while their hearts are left behind, and are far from God, being ſet upon other <hi>objects,</hi> and God hath no true, nor real love, or fear, or accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſervice.</p>
            <p>And in that 'tis ſaid a <hi>Fig-tree,</hi> in the ſingular number, it implies, that every particular <hi>Church,</hi> every individual and particular perſon, ſhall be ſtrictly lookt after, they ſhall not be hid in the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the <hi>Trees,</hi> not loſt in the croud, nor eſcape or remain leſs diſcovered, then <hi>Adam</hi> and his <hi>Wife,</hi> who in vain attempted <hi>to hide themſelves from the preſence of the Lord, amongſt the Trees of the Garden,</hi> Gen. iii. 8. Which I only point to, by way of Alluſion. Every <hi>Tree,</hi> every perſon ſhall be particularly inquired after, and ſought out: if there be but one unfruitful <hi>Tree</hi> it ſhall be diſcovered, the <hi>Lord</hi> of the <hi>Vineyard</hi> will certainly find it out, and ſo will he every one that is ſo, one by
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:107489:164"/> one, be they never ſo many that are ſuch.</p>
            <p>You have heard what the <hi>Lord</hi> and ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the <hi>Vineyard</hi> did. Planted a <hi>Tree,</hi> a <hi>Fig-tree,</hi> which is naturally capable of bearing Fruit, in his <hi>Vineyard,</hi> a good ſoyl apt to nouriſh it, and as 'twas juſt he ſhould, came and ſought Fruit, but was unjuſtly diſappointed. Hear now what he ſaith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then ſaid he to the dreſſer of the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, behold theſe three years I come, ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fruit on this Tree and find none, cut it down, why cumbreth it the ground?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall explain theſe <hi>words</hi> with the like brevity, and then ſum up the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them together.</p>
            <p>And here four particulars muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Who is to be underſtood by the <hi>Dreſſer of the Vineyard,</hi> and why he is told of the <hi>Fig-trees</hi> unfruitfulneſs.</p>
            <p>Secondly, What is meant by the <hi>three years</hi> in which he came ſeeking Fruit of it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, What is meant by the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, to <hi>Cut it down,</hi> and why the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it is injoyned to the Dreſſer of the Vineyard?</p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:107489:164"/>
            <p>Fourthly, What is meant by the <hi>Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring of the Ground,</hi> which contains the reaſon to juſtifie the ſeverity of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of cutting down.</p>
            <p>Firſt, who is to be underſtood by the <hi>Dreſſer of the Vineyard,</hi> the moſt general <hi>opinion</hi> is, that it is the Miniſter, or in complex conſideration the Miniſters of the Goſpel, <hi>Coetus Apoſtolorum,</hi> as a good Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitor expreſſeth it.</p>
            <p>But I meet with other <hi>Opinions</hi> of which I ſhall name four.</p>
            <p>Firſt, 'Tis <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> In various <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables,</hi> God and Chriſt ſuſtain various perſons, as St. <hi>John</hi> xv. 1. God himſelf is the <hi>Vine-dreſſer,</hi> Chriſt the <hi>Vine,</hi> and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Believers the <hi>Branches. I am the true vine, my Father is the husband-man, ye are the branches.</hi> But here Chriſt is the <hi>Dreſſer of the Vineyard,</hi> to whom God hath committed the care of his <hi>Church.</hi> To be ſure 'tis he who is the great and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Interceſſour: and by reaſon of the Interceſſion that the <hi>Dreſſer</hi> here makes, <hi>Lord let it alone this year.</hi> Some Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters refer it to him, as St. <hi>Ambroſe, bonus cultor in quo eccleſiae fundamentum,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Theophilact,</hi> This <hi>Dreſſer</hi> is Chriſt who would water them with his <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> and his <hi>Paſſion,</hi> who had been
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:107489:165"/> fruitleſs under the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Prophets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, The <hi>Civil Magiſtrate</hi> in a Chriſtian State, who is to be the keeper of both <hi>Tables,</hi> to ſee to the maintenance of the true Religion towards God, as well as civil honeſty amongſt men. Who are promiſed <hi>to be Nurſing-Fathers to the Church,</hi> Iſa. xlix. 23. and therefore muſt look to the Children of it. One princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal branch of a Fathers care being that his Children <hi>be trained up in the Nurture and admonition of the Lord.</hi> To become fruitful in the Works of Righteouſneſs, and to coerce and reſtrain thoſe who are otherwiſe. <hi>David</hi> having declared his reſolution, <hi>Pſal.</hi> ci. <hi>ult. I will early deſtroy all the wicked of the Land, that I may cut off all evil doers from the City of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, the third Opinion is, that it is every good man in the <hi>Church</hi> which Prays for others. As St. <hi>Auguſt. Bonus cultor omnis ſanctus in Eccleſia qui orat,</hi> &amp;c. Or 'tis by way of Alluſion every mans own Conſcience, the Soul being the <hi>Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,</hi> Conſcience the keeper of it. <hi>They made me keeper of the Vineyards, but mine own Vineyard have I not kept,</hi> Cant. i. 6. Nothing being more common than for God to convince mens Conſciences of their faults and unfruitfulneſs, to bring
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:107489:165"/> them to Repentance and amendment. which is congruouſly expreſt here. O ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner I have come three years ſeeking for Fruit on thee, and find none, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon bids <hi>Conſcience</hi> do its Office. Check, Rebuke, and even torment them for it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, But the moſt received <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> and what may ſeem moſt proper, is that 'tis the <hi>Miniſters of the Goſpel.</hi> The ordinary Gloſs, makes it the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> St. <hi>Gregory Ordo Praepoſitorum.</hi> 'Tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly their work to plant, and to water what is Planted, to dig and to Manure the Lords Garden, <hi>I have planted, Apollos watered,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> iii. 6.</p>
            <p>Now there may be theſe reaſons, why God directs his ſpeech to the Miniſters, and tells them of the peoples faults. 1. To awaken them to Repentance and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment if they have been acceſſary to them, as the good Lord pardon us, 'tis to be fear'd we too often are. 2. To provoke them to their duty, that they may not contract guilt by their negligence, what God ſpake to <hi>Ezekiel</hi> in another compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, may well be applyed in this. <hi>Eze.</hi> iii. 17, 18, 19. <hi>Son of man, I have made thee a watch-man unto the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael: <hi>therefore hear the word from my mouth and give them warning from me. When I ſay
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:107489:166"/> unto the wicked thou ſhalt ſurely dye, and thou giveſt him not warning, nor ſpeakeſt to warn the wicked from his way to ſave his life, the ſame wicked man ſhall dye in his ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity: but his blood will I require at thy hand. Yet if thou warn the wicked and he turn not from his wickedneſs, nor from his wicked way he ſhall dye in his iniquity, but thou haſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered thy ſoul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So here I have made thee the <hi>Dreſſer</hi> of my <hi>Vineyard,</hi> if thou do not thy duty to make the <hi>Trees</hi> Fruitful, they ſhall be <hi>cut down</hi> for their <hi>unfruitfulneſs,</hi> but I will lay their <hi>unfruitfulneſs</hi> to thy charge. But if they continue <hi>Barren,</hi> notwithſtanding thou haſt done thy part to make them bear <hi>Fruit,</hi> they ſhall be <hi>cut down,</hi> but thou haſt delivered thy own ſoul. 3. To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke them to Pray for them, God loves to have Interceſſion made for his people, and wonders when none will do it. <hi>Iſa.</hi> lix. 16. <hi>He wondered there was no Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor.</hi> Ezek. xxii. 30. <hi>I ſought for a man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them that ſhould make up the hedg, and ſtand in the gap before me for the Land, that I ſhould not deſtroy it: and I found none, therefore I powered out my indignation upon them and conſumed them.</hi> And <hi>Joel</hi> ii. 17. it is injoyned expreſly. <hi>Let the Prieſts, the Miniſters of the Lord weep be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:107489:166"/> the Porch and the Altar, and let them ſay; ſpare thy people, O Lord, and give not thy heritage to reproach.</hi> When <hi>Sodom</hi> it ſelf was to be reckoned with, and God came down to ſee whether their ſin was as great as the cry of it proclaimed it to be. He will firſt acquaint <hi>Abraham</hi> with it, that he may Pray and plead for them, and never left granting till he left asking on their behalf. And when God threatens to conſume the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> as in a moment, <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron Fell on their faces,</hi> Num. xvi. 45. and <hi>Aaron</hi> at <hi>Moſes</hi> direction <hi>took a Cenſer in his hand, and put on Incenſe, the Type</hi> of Prayer, <hi>and ſtood between the living and the dead, and made attonement, and the plague was ſtayed, and</hi> Pſal. cvi. 23. <hi>He ſaid he would have deſtroyed them, had not</hi> Moſes <hi>his choſen ſtood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath.</hi> And here as ſoon as ever the <hi>Dreſſer of the Vineyard</hi> hears the doom, <hi>cut it down,</hi> he falls to interceeding, <hi>Lord</hi> let it alone this year alſo. And indeed mutual Prayer betwixt Miniſters and people is exceeding needful and an indiſpenſable duty. See <hi>Eph.</hi> iii. 14, 20. <hi>Col.</hi> i. 9, 12. 1 <hi>Theſſal.</hi> v. 23. and 2 <hi>Theſſal.</hi> iii. 1. <hi>Brethren Pray for us that the word of the Lord may have free courſe. Heb.</hi> xiii. 18. <hi>Rom.</hi> xv. 30. And I juſtly
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:107489:167"/> fear the neglect, or cold performance of this duty is one great cauſe of the ſmall ſucceſs of the Miniſtry, and the unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of the people, I exhort and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly beſeech you that it may be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The <hi>ſecond</hi> thing to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained in this <hi>verſe</hi> is, what is meant by the <hi>three years.</hi> And there are a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Interpretations given of them, to touch but a few. <hi>Eman. Sa</hi> out of St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe,</hi> expounds it thus. He came to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> in <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> to <hi>Moſes</hi> in the <hi>Law,</hi> to <hi>Mary</hi> in his <hi>Incarnation,</hi> that is to the <hi>Jews</hi> by theſe; but they were not purified by <hi>Circumciſion</hi> becauſe they were <hi>uncircumciſed</hi> in heart, not <hi>Sanctified</hi> by the <hi>Law,</hi> becauſe they were ignorant of its virtue, not <hi>juſtified</hi> becauſe they knew not the Grace of God and would not repent. <hi>Itaque nullus in Synagoga fructus inventus.</hi> St. <hi>Gregory</hi> Interprets it, of the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> the written Law, and the Goſpel. Others of the three ſorts of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by which God diſciplined that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to Obedience, <hi>Judges, Kings, H. Prieſts,</hi> but all in vain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theophilact,</hi> of the three Eſtates or <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods</hi> of mans <hi>Age,</hi> Youth, Manhood, Old Age. Or rather thus, <hi>Childhood, Youth,</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:107489:167"/> and the <hi>Mature Eſtate of Manhood,</hi> then remains only the fourth of <hi>Old Age,</hi> and if the errors and unfruitfulneſs of thoſe, be not redeemed by the fruitfulneſs of this, then there's no hope, but down it muſt for ever. Others literally of the three years of Chriſts publick Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>I will name no more, nor ſtay to cenſure theſe, but I rather ſuppoſe the true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to be, without any myſtery in the number, that it ſignifies many times, a <hi>definite number</hi> being put for an <hi>indefinite,</hi> I have come again, and again, and again, that is, very often. And there is a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture</hi> why he pitches upon <hi>three years,</hi> drawn from an obſervation which Natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts make, that if the <hi>Fig-tree</hi> begin not to bear within three years after its plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it will never bear after. But to paſs that alſo as an uncertain thing and ſo <hi>ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,</hi> it is ſufficient to interpret it for often, the <hi>ternary Number</hi> being uſed ſo, almoſt Proverbially, <hi>Si ter pulſanti,</hi> &amp;c. As if he had ſaid, I have waited long and come often, looking for Fruit, and hitherto my expectation hath been diſappointed, therefore I am weary of forbearing, and will ſuffer the abuſe of my patience no longer, <hi>Cut it down,</hi> that is, execute againſt it the deſerved Judgment. And as this
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:107489:168"/> is injoyned to his Miniſters to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by them, it implyes, 1. That the <hi>Fruitleſs Tree</hi> is worthy to be <hi>Cut down,</hi> and is actually under the Sentence of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, tho the Execution may be defer'd by way of Reprieve. Every unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſinner under the Goſpel, is in a ſtate of actual condemnation, there is only a ſmall reſpiting for a while, and a ſhort reprieve allowed to afford him time to ſue out his pardon, according to that from our Saviours own mouth, St. <hi>John</hi> iii. 18. <hi>He that believeth not is condemned already.</hi> So he that repenteth not is condemned already. 2. He bids his Miniſters <hi>Cut them down,</hi> that is, cut them off by ſharp reproof, and cutting rebukes, and <hi>Church Cenſures;</hi> caſt them out of my <hi>Vineyard,</hi> my <hi>Church,</hi> from my <hi>Ordinances</hi> that they may be aſhamed, that they may be afraid, that they may be awakened. 3. To ſhew the unavoidable certainty of it if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue impenitent, let them know what will certainly be their end, <hi>Jer.</hi> xv. 1. <hi>Caſt them out of my ſight,</hi> declare they ſhall be caſt out, and <hi>Jer.</hi> i. 10. <hi>I have ſet thee over the Nations, to root out, to pull down, to deſtroy, to throw down,</hi> that is, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare who ſhall be ſo dealt with, and I will make it good, what is bound on Earth
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:107489:168"/> ſhall be bound in Heaven. <hi>Say to the wicked it ſhall be ill with him,</hi> thou alſo ſhall be cut off, as before the Text, you ſhall all likewiſe periſh, that is unleſs you repent. 4. <hi>Why cumbreth it the Ground.</hi> This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the reaſon of the Righteous Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of cutting down, and intimates that God never proceeds to ſeverity without cauſe. <hi>And ye ſhall know that I have not done without cauſe, all that I have done in it, ſaith the Lord God,</hi> Eze. xiv. 23. 'Tis a reproachful upbraiding the <hi>Fruitleſs-tree,</hi> the word is rend'red variouſly: it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies to make unprofitable, why takes it up a room to no purpoſe? and keeps out a better, and robs others both of nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and influence, by drawing the fatneſs of the ſoil, and caſting a malignant ſhade! And teacheth us that a man who continues in the Church impenitent. 1. Robs God of the Glory which would redound to him, if he brought forth the Fruits of Righteouſneſs which he ought, for Chriſt ſaith <hi>his Father is glorified when his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples bring forth much fruit,</hi> John xv. 8. and commands that our <hi>Light ſhine before men that they may ſee our good works, and glorifie our Father in Heaven.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that <hi>the fruits of Righteouſneſs are by Jeſus Chriſt to the praiſe and glory of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:107489:169"/> God,</hi> Phil. i. 11. which <hi>Glory</hi> God loſeth by every <hi>Tree</hi> which ſtands on his ground and bears no <hi>Fruit.</hi> 2. Such a man does abundance of miſchief by his bad <hi>example:</hi> imboldens others to be, and continue, as bad as himſelf, and hinders and diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages them from being better. 3. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parages the Soyl, <hi>cauſes the way of truth to be evil ſpoken of,</hi> Gods <hi>Ordinances</hi> to be <hi>vilified,</hi> and his <hi>name to be Blaſphemed,</hi> and his faithful Miniſters to be reproacht as if they were the cauſes of all that wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which they mourn over, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to reform with all their might. As we ſay of ſervants or beaſts that thrive not, look ill, are in bad plight, they ſhame their keeper, as if he ſtarved them, or allowed them not what is ſufficient. So when you who have been <hi>Baptized,</hi> lead bad lives, and go on in <hi>impenitency,</hi> you give great <hi>ſcandal,</hi> cauſe much offence, and put an excuſe into the mouths of thoſe who prophanely neglect and ſlight Chriſts Inſtitutions; and when they are exhorted to frequent them, or reproved for neglecting them, they have this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ready, why ſo much ado about theſe matters? we ſee thoſe who uſe them moſt, are never the better, but as bad or worſe, than thoſe who ſeldom or never meddle
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:107489:169"/> with them, what a ſhame is it to be thus reproached, and to be ſo ill furniſht to refute it? 'Tis a great <hi>offence</hi> that's given by this means, <hi>but wo to the man by whom the offence cometh,</hi> it had been better for him, to have been plunged in the <hi>Sea,</hi> then Planted in the <hi>Vineyard.</hi> For God will ſeverely avenge theſe many evils, which are the Conſequences of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfulneſs, unleſs ſpeedy and ſincere Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and amendment, prevent the Execution of the denounced Sentence.</p>
            <p>And this may ſuffice for the meaning of the two firſt <hi>verſes</hi> of the <hi>Text,</hi> which concern the Lord and Owner of the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, both as to what he did, and what he ſaid. And may be ſummed up in this ſhort recapitulation. The Great God hath in much mercy admitted you into his <hi>Church</hi> by <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and hath often come, to ſee whether you do, and long expected that you ſhould, make good that ſolemn <hi>Covenant</hi> you then made with him, by bringing forth the <hi>Fruits</hi> of ſincere <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> ſound <hi>Faith,</hi> and Univerſal, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſerved new <hi>Obedience;</hi> but hitherto hath not found them, but the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>And therefore bids his <hi>Miniſters,</hi> and you by them, with attention and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:107489:170"/> take notice of his paſt goodneſs, and that he takes ſevere notice of your continuing badneſs, and provoking diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment of his expectation and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and therefore pronounces Sentence againſt you, to <hi>cut</hi> you off from his <hi>Church</hi> by his Spiritual Sword, and that he will <hi>cut</hi> you off from the Land of the Living, for your robbing him of his Glory, for your hindring others by your bad exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be better, or imboldning them to be as bad as your ſelves, and cauſing his Holy Inſtitutions to be evil thought of, and evil ſpoken of, as if they were uſeleſs and of no efficacy, and his <hi>Holy name</hi> to be blaſphemed.</p>
            <p>I now proceed to the other two which concern the <hi>Dreſſer</hi> of the <hi>Vineyard;</hi> the former of which contains his <hi>Interceſſion</hi> that it may be ſpared a little longer, and tryed one more, if yet it may amend. The latter his <hi>conceſſion</hi> that if it do not, then the denounced Sentence take place, and be put in execution, there remaining no ſhaddow of pretence for farther arreſt of Judgment.</p>
            <p>I ſhall endeavour the <hi>Explication</hi> of theſe with the greateſt clearneſs, plainneſs and brevity I can, in order to the <hi>Application</hi> of them, which I again tell you I chiefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend.</p>
            <pb n="27" facs="tcp:107489:170"/>
            <p>In the former, His <hi>Interceſſion,</hi> are two particulars. <hi>Firſt,</hi> an expreſs Prayer in behalf of the <hi>barren tree,</hi> in which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded two requeſts, one for reſpiting the Sentence, and allowing it more time, <hi>Lord let it alone this year alſo.</hi> The other for leave, to beſtow more pains and coſt about it, digging and dunging. <hi>Secondly,</hi> An implied promiſe on his own behalf, that if his Lord will give him leave, and ſpare the <hi>Tree,</hi> he will ſpare neither coſt nor pains, but will do all that Art and Induſtry can perform, he will <hi>dig</hi> about it, and <hi>dung</hi> it, do the beſt and the moſt he can to make it <hi>fruitful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The expreſs Prayer for the <hi>bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren Tree: Lord let it alone this year alſo,</hi> &amp;c. In which the <hi>firſt</hi> branch is for more time. The <hi>ſecond</hi> for leave to beſtow more coſt and pains upon it. <hi>Note</hi> hence. 1. 'Tis the duty of Gods Miniſters to Pray for the people, yea even for the unfruitful, and impenitent amongſt them. <hi>Iſa.</hi> lxii. 6, 7. <hi>I have ſet watch-men upon thy Walls, O</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>which ſhall never hold their peace, day nor night: ye that make mention of the Lord, keep not ſilence: and give him no reſt till he eſtabliſh, and till he make</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem <hi>a praiſe in the Earth.</hi> 2. They muſt not excuſe their <hi>faults,</hi> tho they may and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:107489:171"/> muſt beg pardon for them, that would rob God of the Glory of his Mercy, and harden them in ſecurity, againſt repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and amendment. He tacitely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges the culpableneſs of their paſt <hi>unfruitfulneſs,</hi> and confeſſeth Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in ſuffering them to ſtand ſo long, while he Prays it may be <hi>let alone this year alſo;</hi> it was meer Mercy to let it ſtand ſo long: and it will be more Mercy to let it alone a little longer; therefore, O Lord, <hi>Let it alone this year alſo,</hi> even for thy Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies ſake. 3. He asks not three years more, but one year, after three years <hi>barrenneſs</hi> and diſappointment, they muſt ask modeſtly who would prevail: one years forbearance more, is a great Mercy to them, who have ſinned away many al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. Every day, every hour ſhould be pretious to a Reprieved man, to ſue out his Pardon, and make his Peace. He is now upon his good Behaviour, this is his laſt tryal if he continue and perſiſt in his old wont, Execution proceeds, as againſt one, of whom there is no hope, of proving better.</p>
            <p>The Second <hi>Branch</hi> of his Prayer, is for leave to beſtow more coſt, and pains, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, <hi>Till I dig about it,</hi> there's labour and pains; the Miniſterial Office, when
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:107489:171"/> truly and faithfully diſcharged, is really very laborious. <hi>We beſeech you brethren know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admoniſh you, and eſteem them very highly for their Works ſake.</hi> 1. Theſ. v. 12, 13. <hi>Thoſe who labour in the Word and Doctrine,</hi> 1. Tim. v. 17. Tho the Miniſtry be a great dignity, yet it takes denomination, from duty and ſervice. <hi>We Preach not our ſelves, but Chriſt Jeſus the Lord: and our ſelves your ſervants for Jeſus ſake,</hi> 2 Cor. iv. 5. And our <hi>Lord</hi> himſelf gives his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> both a rule againſt exerciſing Lordſhip, and ſets himſelf as an <hi>example</hi> of it, Lu. xxii. 26, 27. <hi>It ſhall not be ſo with you, but he that is greateſt among you, ſhall be as the youngeſt, and the chief as he that ſerveth. For I am among you as he that ſerveth.</hi> 'Tis well known the word ſo often uſed in the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the Miniſtry, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the moſt painful labour. Such as of thoſe who ſweat, and by their ſpeed in their Travel raiſe the duſt, and digging is one of the hardeſt kinds of labour, ſuch as the <hi>unfaithful Steward</hi> openly confeſſes too hard for him, <hi>I cannot dig,</hi> Luke xvi. But tho Miniſters ſhould labour where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are, they may not labour where they pleaſe. <hi>Paul</hi> and his <hi>Companions</hi> in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:107489:172"/> labour were forbidden of the Holy Ghoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to Preach the Word in <hi>Aſia, And when they aſſayed to go into</hi> Bithynia <hi>the ſpirit ſuffered them not,</hi> Act. xvi. 6, 7. They are <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers but 'tis together with God,</hi> 1 Cor. iii. 9. And muſt have their ſtation aſſigned by him. And as the Lord of the Harveſt muſt be prayed, <hi>To ſend forth Labourers into his Harveſt,</hi> St. Matth. ix. 38. So his leave muſt be obtained to continue and beſtow more labour, in what field ſoever he aſſigns them to work, in and when his <hi>Vineyard</hi> hath provoked him by diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing his expectation, and not anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſt labour and charge beſtowed on it. He paſſes this Sentence againſt it, it ſhall not be <hi>pruned,</hi> nor <hi>digged, And I'l command the clouds that they rain no rain up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it,</hi> Iſa. v. 6. As 'tis not a ſmall Mercy to have faithful and painful Miniſters, ſo 'tis one of the greateſt Judgments to have them removed, and to be put under ſuch as are deſcribed, <hi>Zech.</hi> xi. 16. and therefore God ſhould be ſought by earneſt Prayer, to vouchſafe the Mercy, and avert the Judgment. Next he asks to beſtow coſt as well as pains, there muſt be <hi>dunging</hi> as well as <hi>digging;</hi> 'tis chargeable mending barren Land, yet we muſt not ſtick at this. See 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> xii. 14, 15. <hi>Parents muſt lay up,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:107489:172"/> and lay out too, for their children. I will gladly ſpend and be ſpent for you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> theſe words imply a promiſe on his own behalf, as well as contain an expreſs Prayer on behalf of the people. Lord if thou wilt be intreated to let it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone this year, <hi>I will dig about it and dung it,</hi> I will do all that Art and Induſtry can do, I will not be wanting on my part to perform the moſt, the beſt, All that I can, to make it <hi>Fruitful.</hi> Note, <hi>firſt,</hi> in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, they who would prevail with God, muſt add endeavours to their Prayers, 'tis but a tempting and mocking God to do otherwiſe, <hi>Ora &amp; Labora;</hi> and 'tis a good direction, the <hi>Adage</hi> gives, <hi>Manus ad Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vam, oculus ad Coelum.</hi> The <hi>Hand</hi> on the <hi>Plough,</hi> and the <hi>Eye</hi> lift up to <hi>Heaven</hi> is the <hi>Emblem</hi> of the thriving Husbandman.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Soloman</hi> hath both theſe paſſages in one Chapter, <hi>Prov.</hi> x. 4, and 22. <hi>The hand of the diligent maketh rich, and, The bleſſing of the Lord it maketh rich.</hi> He tempts God, who only Prays, and labours not. He deſpiſeth God, who only la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and Prays not. But he honours and pleaſes him, and ſhall be bleſſed of him, who joyns both together. Remember how <hi>Moſes</hi> concludes the nintieth <hi>Pſalm. Let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:107489:173"/> us, and eſtabliſh the work of our hands upon us: yea the work of our hands eſtabliſh thou it.</hi> The Prayer for bleſſing on their work, ſhews the concurrence of their Works and Prayer. The hard Heart and the ſoft Hand, are both hateful to the Lord: but the ſoft Heart, and the hard Hand are his delight; my meaning is, an Heart that melts in Prayer, and an Hand that is grown callous, and brawny, with induſtrious Conſtancy, in diligent Labour.</p>
            <p>Let me cloſe this, with what I judg a very neceſſary and ſeaſonable advice. When your <hi>Miniſters</hi> viſit you in time of ſickneſs to exhort you, and comfort you, and pray with you, 'tis uſually one part of our exhortation, that if God ſpare you, and reſtore you to health, you would ſhew forth the truth of the <hi>repentance,</hi> you profeſs when you are like to dye, by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth <hi>Fruits meet for Repentance,</hi> if God reſtore you and ſuffer you to live. And 'tis one part of our Prayer, that God would vouchſafe to reſtore you, and afford you more time, to perfect your <hi>Knowledg,</hi> your <hi>Faith,</hi> your <hi>Repentance,</hi> and what ever elſe may make you more fit to dye, with ſafety, and with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. Now if God be pleaſed to hear our Prayers, and to ſpare you and reſtore you,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:107489:173"/> doth not this lay as great an obligation upon us Miniſters, as may be, to apply our ſelves to you, when you are ſo reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, to put you in mind of the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes you made, whilſt you conceived your ſelves in danger of death.</p>
            <p>And as great an engagement upon you, to expect from us, and accept at our hands, willingly and thankfully, our b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt endeavours to aſſiſt you and provoke you to be ſuch, as you wiſh you had been, when you thought you ſhould have dyed. If the <hi>Vine-Dreſſer</hi> here promiſe, that if God will ſpare the <hi>barren-tree,</hi> one year more, after he had threatned to <hi>Cut it down,</hi> he will on his part do, all that Art and Induſtry can do, to make it Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, applying his care to it particularly, beſides the general Husbandry he beſtows upon the whole <hi>Vineyard.</hi> I think no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference can be drawn more clearly, than that when God hath threatned to cut you down by <hi>death,</hi> and the Prayers of your Miniſter, and others have prevailed with God to defer the Sentence, and ſpare you a little longer, it is incumbent on you, both to deſire and accept his help, and on him to offer and afford it you and to do al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:107489:174"/> may be attained, for which God ſpared you, If he ſpared you in his Mercy. And you ſhould be as willing to ſend for your Miniſters when you are recovered, and they as ready to attend you, as when you were in danger; how much this is pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed I know not, but how neceſſary it is that it ſhould be, I <hi>appeal</hi> both to your Conſciences, and to this <hi>Text.</hi> And therefore exhort with earneſtneſs it may.</p>
            <p>But I muſt give the meaning of this <hi>place,</hi> or expreſſion, till I ſhall <hi>dig about it, and dung it,</hi> more particularly, becauſe much of the Application I deſign will have depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon it. <hi>Donec ablaqueavero, &amp; ſtercoravero.</hi> It is an alluſion to what is moſt uſual, and moſt uſeful, to be done, to <hi>barren trees.</hi> 1. Open the Roots, remove the clung Earth, and the hungry Loam, the cold and binding Clay from about them, lay them open to the Weather, let in the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Rain,</hi> and expoſe them to the <hi>influence</hi> of Heaven, the nouriſhing <hi>Dew</hi> and refreſhing <hi>Air,</hi> cut the ſtunted, and ſtarved, and bark-bound <hi>Roots,</hi> that they may ſprout afreſh, put out young <hi>Fibres,</hi> ſhoot out new <hi>Suckers,</hi> and draw nouriſhment to feed them: and lay good Mendment, mellow Dung, ſome richer Soyl, and Earth that's tender, well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:107489:174"/> to warm and nouriſh them, that the <hi>Roots</hi> may have fit nouriſhment, and may be made fit to attract it, and receive it. And if any thing can, this will make the Tree bear <hi>Fruit,</hi> 'tis all that Art and Induſtry can do: and it is capable of. What could have been more? <hi>Iſa.</hi> v. 4. So a Miniſter that interceeds for a people or perſon that they may be ſpared, muſt add to his Prayers all that Spiritual wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom can teach him, and Holy induſtry can aſſiſt him in, to make them better, that they may bring forth the deſired <hi>Fruits</hi> of Righteouſneſs. But to be more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, I find much ſaid concerning both theſe expreſſions, but I confeſs nothing which gives me ſatisfaction, I ſhall therefore, paſſing by all others, confine my ſelf to one <hi>Interpretation,</hi> which appears to me, moſt proper and pertinent, of any I meet with in others, or occurred to my own thoughts.</p>
            <p>But before I name it, I muſt premiſe one <hi>Caveat</hi> to prevent an indecency, and to preſerve a decorum, that you may not take offence at the compariſon, I am about to make, as unſeemly or rude; the word <hi>Dung,</hi> is even of a noyſom ſound, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in itſelf a loathſome ſtinking, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filing thing: but it is not to be look'd on,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:107489:175"/> under that notion, in this place: but in a more benign acceptation, drawn from its uſefulneſs, which is to warm, to mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and communicate a prolifick vertue to the <hi>Earth,</hi> and the <hi>Plants,</hi> to make them Fat and flouriſhing, and exuberant in bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fruit.</p>
            <p>And tho <hi>Dung</hi> on your Cloaths or Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, in your Houſes or your Walks, would be loathſome, and a foul annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; yet in your <hi>Fields,</hi> and <hi>Orchards,</hi> it looks well, and ſmells not ill; but is deſirable, and even comely, becauſe 'tis neceſſary and very uſeful. And ſuppoſe yet to prevent indecency and harſhneſs to the Interpretation, I am about to give, we mollifie the very word, till I may manure it, and lay mendment to it; for in the ſcope of this <hi>Parable,</hi> not the bad, but the good quality of the <hi>Dung</hi> is to be conſidered, not how it marrs by its foulneſs, but how it mends by its fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>This premiſed to prevent prejudice, I now tell you: that by <hi>Digging,</hi> and <hi>Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> I conceive may moſt properly be meant applying the <hi>Law,</hi> and the <hi>Goſpel:</hi> the Threatnings, and the Promiſes; Gods Judgments and Mercies: and the moſt earneſt terrifying ſinners, impenitent bold
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:107489:175"/> and daring ſinners; by the firſt, to bring, them to repentance towards God, and the alluring, wooing, and perſuading, broken-hearted, awakened, trembling ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; by the other, to Faith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Digging</hi> breaks the Ground, the Spade of the Law, the Plough of the Law, breaks up the fallow Ground of the Heart as the <hi>Prophets</hi> phraſe is. Gods wrath revealed from Heaven, againſt the unrighteouſneſs and ungodlineſs of men: in his terrible threatnings, and awakning Judgments, ſtartles the obdurate ſinner, rends the rock he is planted on: tears in pieces his hardned ſecurity, and bold pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, turns up the tough, the cold, and clungy Soyl, in which the very roots of his Heart are ſhut up, and faſtned, and which chill and ſtunt his growth, that he cannot thrive or bear Fruit. And then the Dew and Rain, then the kind and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign influence of the <hi>Sun,</hi> may reach and cheriſh him: then the good Soyl, the freſh mendment, the prolifick Manure, and the mellow tender Mould, may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed and come near. Even the tender Mercies of God, and the warm blood of Jeſus Chriſt, and the pretious promiſes of Pardon, Life, and Grace, by which
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:107489:176"/> theſe are offered and applyed. 'Tis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and practiſed, that to apply blood to the <hi>Root</hi> of a Tree, a Vine eſpecially, is the beſt and moſt proper means to make it <hi>fruitful.</hi> And <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> tell us, that the <hi>Vallies</hi> and <hi>Gardens</hi> about <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> were rendered Fertile beyond expreſſion, almoſt to a <hi>Miracle:</hi> by the abundance of blood, which flowed down (by the Vaults, made on purpoſe to conveigh it away, under the <hi>Temple,</hi>) from the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the Sacrifices which were offered there. And I am ſure there is nothing comparable to the blood of the great <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,</hi> of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to make a <hi>barren</hi> Heart fruitful, eſpecially if it be firſt well dug about by the Spade of the Law, and the Roots of it laid bare and open to receive the due application of it.</p>
            <p>And he that will or doth interceed, to have a barren, an impenitent people ſpared; muſt add to his Prayers for them, his beſt his utmoſt endeavours with them, to dig about them <hi>firſt,</hi> by convincing them of ſin, rebuking and reproving them cuttingly, till like St. <hi>Peters</hi> Hearers <hi>Acts</hi> ii. <hi>They be tricked to the Heart.</hi> By denouncing the Laws, Curſe, and Gods Judgments. By ſhewing them their loſt and undone condition, by ſtripping them
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:107489:176"/> of all their <hi>excuſes,</hi> and falſe confidences, by teaching them the neceſſity of a ſpeedy and ſincere repentance, and by urging and preſſing them to fly from the wrath to come, and removing all their preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of peace and ſafety, (while they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ignorant, and deſtitute of Gods Righteouſneſs) which lye like cold Earth, and clungy ſullen <hi>Loam,</hi> about their Hearts, and hinder them from drawing any nouriſhment which may make them thrive, or bear the Fruit which God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects.</p>
            <p>And when this is done, then lay freſh Mould, and mellow tender Earth about them, then offer and apply unto them the promiſes of Pardon, Peace and Life, through the tender Mercies of our God, in the blood of our dear Redeemer Jeſus Chriſt Exhorting, inviting, perſuading, beſeeching, alluring, and by the Holy violence of Love, even conſtraining and compelling them, to turn, come in, and be reconciled to God. And if any thing, will make a <hi>barren tree,</hi> bear <hi>Fruit;</hi> If any thing will make a ſtubborn, and an hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſinner yield, and relent, repent and amend, and bring forth Fruit to God, this will do it.</p>
            <pb n="40" facs="tcp:107489:177"/>
            <p>
               <hi>And if it bear fruit, well; and if not, then after that, thou ſhalt cut it down.</hi> This laſt <hi>Verſe</hi> of the <hi>Text</hi> contains the <hi>Dreſſer</hi> of the <hi>Vineyards</hi> ſubmiſs conceſſion, and willing yielding, to the putting the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of exciſion, and cutting the <hi>Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Tree</hi> down, as moſt equitable and juſt, if it ſtill continue <hi>Fruitleſs</hi> after more patience, and more pains and coſt allowed it, and beſtowed upon it in vain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If it bear Fruit.</hi> 'Tis an imperfect <hi>Speech,</hi> in which ſomewhat is expreſt, and ſomewhat ſuppreſt, which is ta be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed and underſtood, a <hi>form</hi> of <hi>ſpeaking</hi> which men uſe when they ſpeak with emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, vehemency, and a great Pathos. <hi>Apoſiopeſis,</hi> or <hi>Anantopodoton,</hi> a figure pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to, and of frequent uſe in the <hi>Attick dialect.</hi> 'Tis ſeldom hard to ſupply it, and make the Sence perfect, in this place 'tis very eaſie, and obvious. Thou ſhalt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it to ſtand, and not cut it down. Our <hi>Tranſlatours</hi> have done it briefly, yet ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently; <hi>well:</hi> As we uſe to ſay, when we exhort, perſuade, threaten, promiſe, with an implyed condition, if you will do ſo or ſo, well and good, if not, then take what follows. So here, if the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent</hi> ſinner, will repent and turn to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:107489:177"/> God, <hi>and bring forth fruits meet for repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> then God will put all his <hi>paſt iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> out of his <hi>remembrance,</hi> and will ſpare and not deſtroy him. And there is, if I may ſo ſpeak, a great efficacy in the ſuppreſſing of the <hi>anſwer,</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> of the <hi>Vineyard</hi> gives conſent, by his ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and ſaith much, by ſaying nothing, but leaves it to be taken for granted, he yields and is content it ſhould be ſo. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuit,</hi> ſuch a gratious holding of his Peace, is as <hi>ſignificative,</hi> as if he had ſaid, as elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where: <hi>Say to the Righteous it ſhall be well with him.</hi> And this manner of inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating has mind, hath its great uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it gives the higheſt degree of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, never doubt it, queſtion it not in the leaſt: no man <hi>Plants Trees</hi> in his <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard,</hi> meerly to make Fuel of, but to bear Fruit: and had a great deal rather they ſhould ſtand, to anſwer that end; than cut them down to be burnt; and when they anſwer his firſt deſire and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, will never do it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As I live ſaith the Lord, I have no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the death of the wicked, but rather that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways, for why will ye dye,</hi> Ezek. xxxiii. 11. The <hi>Tree</hi> which hath been long <hi>barren,</hi> the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:107489:178"/> 
               <hi>Chriſtian</hi> which hath been long <hi>unfruitful,</hi> yet if upon digging and dunging, if upon new endeavours, and freſh application made to him, he <hi>bear Fruit,</hi> I need not tell it you, you may be ſure on't, and take it for granted, he ſhall be ſpared, and not cut down. <hi>He ſhall ſurely live, he ſhall not dye.</hi> Ezeck. xviii. 21.</p>
            <p>But if not, <hi>Then after that thou ſhalt cut it down.</hi> If it do not bear <hi>Fruit</hi> after all this patience with it, in ſparing it ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther year, and all the coſt and pains of digging and dunging it, then <hi>cut it down</hi> and ſpare not, I have no more to ſay for it, I'le never ſpeak word more in its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half.</p>
            <p>They, who after long <hi>barrenneſs</hi> add a ſecure and obſtinate <hi>unfruitfulneſs,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a freſh indulged patience, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed calls, warnings, and means to make them <hi>fruitful,</hi> to bring them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and amendment, ſhall be ſurely, ſuddenly, ſeverely cut down, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, apology, or pity. According to that of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Proverbs xxix. 1. <hi>He that being often reproved hardneth his neck ſhall ſuddenly be deſtroyed and that without remedy. He flees to the pit, let no man ſtay him.</hi>

            <pb n="43" facs="tcp:107489:178"/>
            <p>We may ſum up the meaning of theſe two <hi>Verſes,</hi> in this ſhort recapitulation, by way of <hi>Paraphraſe;</hi> as if he had ſpoken plainly to this Sence. <hi>O Lord I humbly acknowledg thou haſt exerciſed great long-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, and ſhewed much mercy already to this ſinful people, to this, and that impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent man, and woman, yet I beſeech thee for thy meer mercy ſake, ſpare them a little longer, try them yet once more: and give me leave, opportunity and an heart, to convince them of their duty, to make them ſenſible of their danger, to perſuade them to do the one, and avoid the other, and I promiſe and engage my ſelf, by thy Grace to do all that Art and Induſtry can do: all that Chriſtian Charity, and my Miniſterial Compaſſions and Office can do, proportionable to thoſe Talents and Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities thou haſt vouchſafed to intruſt me with, to bring them to Repentance. And if by thy bleſſing, thoſe endeavours ſucceed and proſper: I know,</hi> O Lord, <hi>Thou wilt of thy goodneſs pardon what is paſt, and ſpare them, and Repeal thy Sentence, and repent thee of the evil denounced againſt them, But if after thy granting what I have Prayed, and my performing what I have Promiſed, they will take no warning, but continue ſecure and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate, as hitherto. Then,</hi> Lord, <hi>do with them as thou pleaſeſt, execute upon them what
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:107489:179"/> ſeems good in thine own Eyes. Thy</hi> Juſtice <hi>will be clear; I ſhall be free from their blood; they will be without</hi> excuſe, <hi>and all the fault, and guilt, will light upon their own heads. Cut them down and ſpare not. I will not, I cannot ſpeak one word more, in their behalf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I have as conciſely as I could, and with the moſt eaſie and familiar ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, explained this excellent <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;</hi> and now diveſting it of the <hi>Figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> and borrowed words, I might ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you the <hi>Propoſitions</hi> and <hi>Obſervations</hi> in which the Scope and Strength of it is comprehended.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>When God hath received any man into his Church by Baptiſm, He expects he ſhould, and will ſtrictly take notice whether he doth perform his Baptiſmal Covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Every man profeſſing Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, and not living of his Covenant of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity binds him, is actually under a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of condemnation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>God is gratiouſly ready upon In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion made to him, to grant a Reprieve, and reſpite Judgment, and try ſuch men whether they will return and amend, and if they do, will ſpare and Pardon them.</hi> But,</p>
            <pb n="45" facs="tcp:107489:179"/>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>If this forbearance, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God prevail not to make them Repent and return, God and man, Heaven and Earth conſpire and reſolve the ſpeedy, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, the immutable, the Righteous deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſuch men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might proceed upon all, or ſingle out ſome one of theſe, and give clear Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, of the truth; and convincing Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the Equity, and Righteouſneſs, of them. But I wave that method at preſent, and ſhall conclude all with an <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication</hi> the whole to our ſelves, ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Explication which hath been given.</p>
            <p>And this <hi>Application</hi> may be twofold. <hi>Firſt,</hi> looking upon the <hi>Fig-tree</hi> as a <hi>Type</hi> and <hi>Figure</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> in this Nation, which with reſpect to the <hi>Catholick</hi> or <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church,</hi> as the <hi>Vineyard,</hi> is as a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Tree Planted in it. And ſo the <hi>Application</hi> mightily alarums us all, to live as that Holy and Excellent <hi>Religion,</hi> God hath vouchſafed to us, requires and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects us. For fear of, and under the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty, of being deprived and bereaved of it. And pulled up by the very Roots, out of that good <hi>Soyl</hi> we are Planted in, or ſtript of our defence and laid waſt, and both the wall demoliſht, and the hedge
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:107489:180"/> thrown down, to let in upon us, <hi>the little Foxes,</hi> and the great <hi>Wild-Boar,</hi> to ſpoyl our Branches, and to turn up our Roots. And I the rather touch this becauſe the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Letter of the <hi>Text</hi> comes home to us <hi>in terminis,</hi> and fits our circumſtances as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly as if it had primarily been adapted to us, and deſigned for us.</p>
            <p>Amongſt other Interpretations of the <hi>three years,</hi> given in the <hi>Explication;</hi> one was the <hi>Governours</hi> under which the <hi>Church</hi> had been Defended and Diſciplined to O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. How <hi>Paralel</hi> is this to our Caſe? We have injoyed the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> the True Reformed <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> under three <hi>Proteſtant Princes</hi> of Glorious Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory. The famous Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the Learned King <hi>James</hi> and the Royal Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt.</p>
            <p>In all whoſe <hi>Reigns</hi> God came and lookt for <hi>Fruit</hi> ſutable to his coſt and care, and our opportunities; but how much his <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation</hi> was diſappointed, we may with ſhame and ſadneſs reflect, if we call to mind the <hi>gradual</hi> declining from the power of Godlineſs, and Zeal for the Life of our <hi>Holy Religion.</hi> And if that convince us not, the ſtretching out his hand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, and the bloody confuſions by which he threatned to cut down our
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:107489:180"/> 
               <hi>Church,</hi> and the buſie deſigns and proud hopes of our reſtleſs Enemies may. And yet then he raiſed up, and ſet over us, our preſent <hi>Gratious King,</hi> (whom God in his infinite Mercy preſerve long to us) who hath given us, and the world, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny open, and publick aſſurances, of his maintayning the True <hi>Proteſtant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and under his Government we yet injoy it. God letting us alone this year alſo, and if we now bear <hi>Fruit, Well:</hi> if we live anſwerable to the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> yet continued to us, in <hi>Righteouſneſs, Sobriety,</hi> and <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> we have yet hope we may be ſpared, and the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and the True <hi>Religion</hi> continued to us; but if we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him, and in this <hi>Year,</hi> which is as a <hi>Year</hi> of our Reprieve, and tryal: we prove, or continue, as bad as heretofore, or rather grow worſe, Profane, Looſe, Lukewarm, Formal, Contentious, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious, proud, Cenſuring, Reviling, Worrying one another, caſting all the fault, and the blame, upon others, as like to bring upon us the evils we fear, and excuſing, flattering and indulging our ſelves in our Luſts, and refuſing to bring forth the pleaſant and excellent <hi>Fruits,</hi> which our moſt <hi>Holy Religion</hi> is naturally apt to produce, wherever it hath poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:107489:181"/> of mens Hearts in truth. What can we expect but that Gods vengeance find us out, and he rid himſelf of us.</p>
            <p>And proceed to put his <hi>Sentence</hi> againſt us, in execution and <hi>cut us down,</hi> as a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Church,</hi> even by the Roots, and let in upon the Nation, the heavieſt plague, that ever an <hi>Holy God</hi> in his fierce wrath, avenged the deſpiſing and abuſe of his <hi>Goſpel</hi> by. I may, I hope without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, declare my juſt fears, that if <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould uſe as ſtrict a ſcrutiny towards us, as he did to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> Rev. ii. He would not find ſo many <hi>good</hi> things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, as he owns he found in that <hi>Church,</hi> and there commends them for, <hi>verſe</hi> 2, and 3, and that he would find more <hi>evils</hi> in us, than he there charges them with: which is only becauſe they had <hi>declined</hi> in their <hi>Zeal, left their firſt love, verſe</hi> 4. and yet let us with fear and trembling read and conſider what he writes to that <hi>Church, verſe</hi> 5. <hi>Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the firſt works, or elſe I will come unto the quickly, and remove thy Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſtick out of his place except thou repent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might alſo <hi>Paralel</hi> the caſe of moſt of the other <hi>Churches</hi> with our <hi>Church,</hi> and the threats denounced againſt them,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:107489:181"/> with what we have cauſe to expect and fear, thereby to provoke us to be <hi>ſpeedy, and zealous to repent,</hi> while this <hi>Year</hi> of Grace laſts: left his provoked patience, both haſten the expiring of this <hi>Year,</hi> and alſo expire, and end with it, and the thing which we fear, come upon us, in its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. I mean the loſs of our <hi>Religion,</hi> becauſe we have not improved it, as we ought to have done. Let us not ſlatter our ſelves, though we had not ſo viſible, and near a proſpect of our dangers, God can eaſily make his <hi>Decrees</hi> bring forth, and his <hi>Vengeance</hi> overtake us, yea over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm us, tho we ſaw no <hi>Inſtruments</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, to bring it about. Thoſe <hi>Seven Churches,</hi> have many <hi>Ages</hi> ſince felt the direful effects of his threatned Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And ſeeing he ſpared not them, Oh that we could timely, and wiſely fear, leſt he alſo ſpare not us. I know the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſtartled and awakened, and there are great thoughts of Heart, great ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Heart deſervedly about this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and if any be aſleep in ſuch a <hi>ſtorm,</hi> its to be ſuſpected 'tis thoſe, for whoſe ſake this <hi>tempeſt</hi> is moſt likely to te upon us. And I know there are many <hi>projects</hi> to prevent the <hi>evil,</hi> we have ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and may ſo juſtly fear. But there is
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:107489:182"/> one means, which if it were as eaſie to prevail with men to practiſe, as 'tis obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to be diſcovered, would alone ſave us, or put a bleſſing, upon what ever elſe might be innocently propounded, to bring us unto ſafety: and no good man need be afraid, or aſhamed, to propound it: and he muſt be a very bad man, who will not be aſhamed, to reproach it, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it. And 'tis what Chriſt gives to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Laodicea, Rev.</hi> iii. 19. <hi>Be zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and repent.</hi> 'Tis that which St. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> gave, when wrath was coming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace, and the <hi>Axe was laid to the Root of the Tree.</hi> St. <hi>Matth.</hi> iii. 8. <hi>Bring forth fruits meet for repentance.</hi> 'Tis that which our preſent <hi>Parable</hi> ſuggeſts: <hi>If it bear fruit,</hi> Well: this will cauſe an Arreſt of Judgment: this will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Repeal of the pronounced Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>
            <p>In what words ſhall I propound this <hi>Counſel,</hi> with what <hi>Arguments</hi> may I ſo preſs it, as to render it effectual, with what <hi>Motives</hi> ſhall I inforce it, that it may be prevalent?</p>
            <p>I have many things to ſay, when I come to apply the <hi>Parable</hi> perſonally, to urge you to <hi>repent</hi> to ſave your ſouls. And ſurely 'tis a great word, to <hi>ſave</hi> our <hi>Souls,</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:107489:182"/> but may I not ſay, 'tis a greater word to ſave a <hi>Church,</hi> to ſave our <hi>Religion,</hi> in which, and by which, our Souls muſt be ſaved: and thouſands, and millions of Souls may be ſaved, if that be ſaved, and may (humanely ſpeaking) be loſt for ever, if true <hi>Religion</hi> be loſt; and if it be loſt by our default, where ſhall the <hi>loſs</hi> of all thoſe ſouls be charged? How warmly, how Pathetically doth the great <hi>Apoſtle</hi> warn his dear <hi>Timothy</hi> in this affair, in a caſe of like concernment? And how doth he reiterate the charge to make all ſure? <hi>O Timothy keep that which is committed to thy truſt,</hi> 1 Tim. vi. 20. And 2 Tim. i. 13, 14. <hi>Hold faſt the form of ſound words, which thou haſt heard of me, in faith and love.</hi> And, <hi>That good thing which was committed to thee, keep by the holy Ghoſt.</hi> And he muſt tranſmit to others what was committed unto him. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> ii. 2. <hi>The things which thou haſt heard of me among many witneſſes, the ſame commit thou to faithful men who ſhall be able to teach others alſo.</hi> We owe to <hi>Poſterity,</hi> what we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from our <hi>Progenitours.</hi> He leaves his name as a <hi>blot,</hi> nay as a <hi>curſe</hi> to his <hi>deſcendents,</hi> who intercepts, and robs them of, the Care and Providence, and noble acquiſitions of their <hi>common Anceſtours.</hi>

               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:107489:183"/> A <hi>Religion</hi> that dare bear the teſt of the true <hi>Lydian-Stone;</hi> The <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> becauſe it is not conſcious to it ſelf, of any counterfeit metal ſtampt and impoſed on unwary minds, by its Authority, to paſs for good Coyn, and currant mony.

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:107489:186"/> Lord of Hoſts, the ſupream, the Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, the Irreſiſtible <hi>judg</hi> of all the Earth, <hi>Hath prepared for thee, the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of death. He hath whet his Sword, he hath bent and made ready his Bow, his Arrows are upon the ſtring: ſuddenly will he ſhoot at thee,</hi> and not <hi>ſpare,</hi> or <hi>miſs</hi> his <hi>mark. The Ax is laid</hi> to thy very <hi>Root,</hi> to cut thee down for fire unquench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. God already deſpiſeth, reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and upbraideth thee for cumbring of his Ground, hath actually pronounced the <hi>Sentence</hi> againſt thee, to cut thee down: the word is gone out of his mouth; only in admirable <hi>Patience,</hi> he hath reprieved thee <hi>one year more,</hi> a little longer, to try whether thou wilt yet at laſt ſue out a <hi>Pardon,</hi> return, repent, amend, that thou mayſt live. Yet if thou do it not <hi>quickly,</hi> he will compenſate the former <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments</hi> of his expectation, whilſt <hi>year</hi> after <hi>year</hi> he came looking for <hi>Fruit</hi> and found none, together with the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated abuſe of his <hi>long-ſufferance,</hi> which vouchſafes another <hi>year,</hi> with a ſeverer vengeance, with a greater Damnation.</p>
            <p>As for our parts who are Gods <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,</hi> it is no pleaſure nor delight to us, to be <hi>Meſſengers</hi> of ſo heavy <hi>tydings,</hi> to come on ſo harſh and terrifying an <hi>Errand.</hi>

But we muſt not chuſe our own <hi>Meſſage:</hi> but the Word God puts into our mouths, that muſt we ſpeak. <hi>What we have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Lord, that muſt we deliver to you,</hi> according to our <hi>Commiſſion</hi> and our <hi>Inſtructions</hi> written in his Word, muſt we proceed in the diſcharge and execution of our <hi>Office.</hi> We muſt not <hi>ſow Pillows un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your Armpits, nor dawb with untemper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mortar,</hi> at the <hi>Price,</hi> at the <hi>Peril,</hi> of our own <hi>Souls.</hi> Nor promiſe <hi>Life</hi> where God hath threatned <hi>Death.</hi> Nor ſpeak <hi>Peace,</hi> where God ſaith there is <hi>no Peace.</hi> And <hi>there is no peace to the wicked, ſaith my God,</hi> Iſa. lvii. 21.

            </p>
            <p>What we may do, and what we can do, that by the Grace of God we will do. We will Pray to God to let you alone <hi>this year</hi> alſo. Spare thy people <hi>good Lord,</hi>

            <p>All theſe, and many more, have an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy aptitude, to hinder your bearing <hi>Fruit,</hi> and make you <hi>barren,</hi> in ſome the <hi>hardneſs</hi> of the <hi>Rock</hi> prevents the taking <hi>Root.</hi> In others the <hi>Thorns</hi> draw away the good nouriſhment, or growing up about it, <hi>Shade</hi> and over drop it, keep away the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Weather,</hi> and ſtifle and pinch it up, it hath no room to ſpread: <hi>The cares of the world, the love of riches, and the luſts of other things choak the ſeed,</hi> and the Plants,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:107489:189"/> that they <hi>bring no Fruit to perfection,</hi> Mark iv. 19. In others, the overvaluing of their outward priviledges, as thoſe <hi>Jews, Jeremiah</hi> writes of Chap. vii. Who cryed, <hi>The temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord.</hi> And thoſe in our <hi>Saviours</hi> time St. <hi>John</hi> viii. <hi>We are</hi> Abrahams <hi>ſeed, we have</hi> Abraham <hi>to our Father.</hi> Or the <hi>Opinion</hi> of their attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Like the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> Rev. iii. <hi>Who ſaid ſhe was rich, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed in goods, and had need of nothing.</hi> Or <hi>boaſting</hi> in their formal duties, as that <hi>Phariſee,</hi> Luk. xviii. <hi>I faſt twice a week, I pay tithes of all I poſſeſs.</hi> Or <hi>proud</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring your ſelves with ſome notorious, flagitious ſinners, <hi>I thank God I am not like ſuch an one,</hi> nor do like ſuch an one, nor like that <hi>Publican.</hi> Some of theſe, or ſomthing like theſe, lies at the Root of moſt mens Hearts, and chils, or ſtarves, or binds, or choaks them, that they bear no Fruit, nor anſwer Gods expectation, tho they have a ſtanding in his <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So many now a days, and it may be ſome of your ſelves, are prone to ſay we are <hi>good Proteſtants,</hi> we are no <hi>Papiſts,</hi> no, nor we are no <hi>Phanaticks:</hi> But we are true <hi>Sons</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> we have been <hi>Baptiſed,</hi>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:107489:189"/> we keep our <hi>Church,</hi> we ſay our <hi>Prayers,</hi> we receive the <hi>Sacrament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As if the <hi>outward waſhing</hi> would <hi>ſave</hi> you, without the <hi>anſwer of a good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence toward God;</hi> and making your <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> with God, without the keeping of it. Or coming to <hi>Church</hi> without learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or practiſing what you are here taught, or calling upon God without <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from iniquity,</hi> and lifting up your hands, tho they be full of <hi>Blood, Bribes</hi> or <hi>Oppreſſion.</hi> Or receiving the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> without <hi>diſcerning the Lords Body,</hi> or conſidering what you do. Or ſtanding in the <hi>Vineyard</hi> without bearing <hi>Fruit.</hi> When that is the very ground of Gods Controverſie with you, and the thing that haſtens your ruin, and you might ſtand longer in an Hedg-row, or on a Common, than in Gods incloſure.</p>
            <p>Now as when the <hi>Gardiner</hi> digs about a <hi>Tree,</hi> it is to looſen the clung Earth, take away the bad, lay open the Roots, that he may lay better to them, as was toucht before, ſuch muſt be the end of our Spiritual, our <hi>Miniſterial</hi> digging about your Hearts. And as I conceive this <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,</hi> is equivalent to that of <hi>breaking up the fallow ground of the Heart,</hi> to Plow up the Weeds and Thorns, and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:107489:190"/> make it mellow and tender to receive the <hi>Seed:</hi> as that muſt be done by the <hi>Plough</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> ſo muſt this with the <hi>Spade</hi> of the <hi>Law. Docendo, monendo, convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendo, redarguendo,</hi> by teaching, admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing, convincing, reproving, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as a good <hi>Expoſitor</hi> expreſſeth it, which are all the proper works of the Law.</p>
            <p>That we may therefore apply our ſelves rightly to this work. In the 29th. of <hi>Deuteronomy, verſe</hi> 18. we read of <hi>a root bearing gall and wormwood,</hi> very bad, very bitter <hi>Fruit,</hi> and the next <hi>verſe</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes him to be one, that <hi>bleſſeth himſelf in his heart, and ſaith he ſhall have peace, tho he add drunkenneſs to thirſt,</hi> and the 12. <hi>verſe</hi> before, and the 25. after ſeems to intimate the grounds or occaſion of that his confidence, becauſe he was entred into <hi>Covenant</hi> with God. As if that would ſecure him from danger, Now I beſeech you obſerve with what Spade <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf digs about this Root, <hi>verſe</hi> 20. <hi>The Lord will not ſpare him, but the anger of the Lord, and his jealouſie ſhall ſmoak againſt that man, and all the curſes that are written in this book ſhall lye upon him: And the Lord ſhall blot out his name from under heaven. And the Lord
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:107489:190"/> ſhall ſeparate him unto evil, out of all the Tribes of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>according to all the curſes of the Covenant that are written in the Book of this Law.</hi> Read what follows at your leiſure, as alſo <hi>Deut.</hi> xxviii. more largely from <hi>verſe</hi> xv. to the end, which contains 54. <hi>verſes:</hi> and many more heavy <hi>curſes,</hi> and dreadful <hi>threatnings,</hi> according to what he ſpeaks, <hi>Deut.</hi> xxxii. 23. <hi>I will heap miſchiefs upon them.</hi> And ſo <hi>Levit.</hi> xxvi. he threatens them with moſt ſevere Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and tells them <hi>he will puniſh them ſeven, and ſeven, and ſeven times more for their ſins,</hi> unleſs they repent and amend: <hi>Till he pluckt them up by the very roots, out of the good land wherein he had planted them.</hi> And in the ſame method do all the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi> proceed, as were eaſie to give in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in <hi>Samuel, Davids Pſalms</hi> moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, <hi>Solomon, Iſaiah, Jeremiah, Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiel, Daniel,</hi> and the reſt, and the ſame inſtruments do they all uſe to the ſame end: but I leave a thing ſo very obvious to your own obſervation in reading of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> of the <hi>Old Teſtament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> in this, is like the <hi>Old.</hi> You cannot but take notice, how <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> begins his Miniſtry, <hi>Matth.</hi> iii. <hi>Bring forth fruits meet for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> and how doth he urge them ſo to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:107489:191"/> do? Firſt by digging away that bad Earth from about their Roots: their flattering themſelves with a falſe confidence in their outward priviledges. <hi>Thinks not to ſay we have</hi> Abraham <hi>to our Father:</hi> and then by threatning them with cutting down. <hi>The Ax is laid to the root of the tree, and every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit,</hi> ſhall, nay, is <hi>hewen down and caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fire.</hi> He ſpeaks of it as done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, to convince them of the certainty of it. And again, <hi>One is coming after him, mightier than he, and his fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and burn up the chaff with fire unquenchable.</hi> And nothing is more frequent in the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> and <hi>Parables</hi> of our <hi>Lord</hi> himſelf, than ſuch uſeful and faithful ſeverity, to awaken ſecure ſinners, by ſuch wholſome comminations of their danger: as every attentive reader may obſerve. To touch a few of very many, <hi>Matth.</hi> xi. 20. <hi>Then began he to upbraid the Cities in which moſt of his mighty works were done, becauſe they repented not. Wo to thee</hi> Chorazin, <hi>wo to thee</hi> Bethſaida, <hi>for if the mighty works which have been done in you had been done in</hi> Tyre <hi>and</hi> Sidon, <hi>they would have repented long ago in ſackcloth and aſhes. And I ſay unto you it ſhall be more tolerable for</hi> Tyre <hi>and</hi>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:107489:191"/> Sidon <hi>in the day of Judgment than for you. And thou</hi> Capernaum, <hi>which art exalted unto heaven</hi> (by the injoyment of ſuch means) <hi>ſhall be brought down to hell:</hi> (for the abuſe of them) <hi>For if the mighty works which were done in you, had been done in</hi> Sodom, <hi>it would have remained to this day. But I ſay unto you it ſhall be more tolerable for the land of</hi> Sodom, <hi>in the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than for thee.</hi> What ſtinging words are theſe, how ſhould they awaken us to ſpeedy Repentance?</p>
            <p>This is alſo the ſcope of many of the <hi>Parables</hi> in <hi>Matth.</hi> xiii. of the <hi>Sower</hi> and the <hi>Seed,</hi> of the <hi>Drag Net,</hi> of the <hi>Tares:</hi> to inſtance in the laſt. The <hi>Tares</hi> in the Field, ſeem to run <hi>parallel</hi> with the <hi>barren figtree</hi> in the <hi>Vineyard, verſe</hi> 40. the <hi>Tares</hi> are burnt in the fire. <hi>The ſon of man ſhall ſend forth his Angels and they ſhall ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of his Kingdom all things that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, and them that do iniquity and caſt them into a furnace of fire, there ſhall be wailing and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi> His <hi>Kingdom,</hi> that is his <hi>Church:</hi> and you ſee 'tis not enough to be in his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> but to be a <hi>Loyal Subject</hi> in his Kingdom, and to yield him willing and faithful Obedience, and ſuch is the caſe with him who wanted the <hi>Wedding Garment,</hi> Matth. xxii. and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:107489:192"/> with the <hi>fooliſh Virgins,</hi> that provided no <hi>Oyl,</hi> and the <hi>ſlothful ſervant</hi> that traded not with his <hi>Talent,</hi> Matth. xxv. So Mark xvi. 16. <hi>He that believeth and is Baptiſed ſhall be ſaved, but he that believeth not ſhall be damned,</hi> tho he were <hi>Baptiſed,</hi> yea, the more becauſe he was <hi>Baptiſed,</hi> and did not what he was thereby obliged to.</p>
            <p>But no where more fully than in the beginning of this <hi>Chapter. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs you repent you ſhall all periſh,</hi> and beſides my <hi>Text, verſe</hi> 24. <hi>Strive to enter in at the ſtrait gate,</hi> and that quickly before the <hi>Maſter of the houſe be riſen,</hi> for it will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards be in vain, to plead, we have <hi>Eat</hi> and <hi>Drunk</hi> in thy preſence, come to thy <hi>Table,</hi> heard thee Preach.

            <p>And the <hi>Holy Apoſtles,</hi> the moſt skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and moſt faithful Labourers in Gods Vineyard, uſe the ſame method, warning the unfruitful by the terrors of the Lord.

He warns them by the <hi>Example</hi> of the <hi>Jewiſh Branches</hi> being cut off from their <hi>Olive-Tree,</hi> and bids them <hi>take heed leſt God alſo ſpare not them,</hi> and expreſly tells them that if they continue not in Gods goodneſs, anſwer not his goodneſs towards them, <hi>they alſo ſhall be cut off.</hi> 'Tis hard to forbear offering more, but I confeſs it rather needs an <hi>Apology</hi> for ſaying ſo much, in ſo manifeſt a caſe, than an <hi>Excuſe</hi> for ſaying no more, yet they that conſider for how plain a people theſe things were firſt prepared, and now written, may paſs by the error, if I have exceeded.</p>
            <p>And now to dig the deeper about you, even to the bottom of your Roots, to the very Root of your Hearts: let me uſher in what I have to offer to you, with theſe conſiderations.</p>
            <pb n="72" facs="tcp:107489:193"/>
            <p>Firſt, You ſtand not on an <hi>Heath</hi> or <hi>Forreſt,</hi> on a <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> or <hi>Common,</hi> in a <hi>Wood</hi> or <hi>Hedg-row,</hi> where you might ſtand long, and none look after you, neither God nor Man expect fruit from you. <hi>The times, the places of Ignorance,</hi> when and where men have not the <hi>light</hi> of the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,</hi> to ſhew them their Duty, or their Danger in neglecting it, <hi>God winketh at, Acts</hi> 17.30. takes leſs notice of But when and where his <hi>Goſpel</hi> is vouchſafed, <hi>He calls all men to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.</hi> Becauſe, by that, he lets them know <hi>He hath appointed a man, by whom he will judge the World in Righteouſneſs, and hath given full aſſurance of it, by raiſing him from the Dead.</hi> But you are planted in a rich Soil: as God's <hi>Vineyard</hi> of old, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.1. in a very fruitful hill, cultivated, dreſſed, tilled with no ſmall coſt and care, it was <hi>digged,</hi> and <hi>fenced,</hi> and the <hi>Stones</hi> picked out. You live in a <hi>Church</hi> where you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the <hi>Holy Scriptures to be a light to your Feet, and lamp to your Paths;</hi> and have the truth and excellency of the Goſpel, fully ſet forth, and plainly preacht, explained and applyed to you, and the whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of God, concerning your Eternal eſtate, declared, and nothing kept back, which may be neceſſary or profitable for
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:107489:193"/> you: You have the <hi>Holy Sacraments</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred to you, according to Chriſts Inſtitution, without maiming, or defil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, with mens Superſtitious inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions added. You have <hi>Prayers</hi> made in a Tongue you underſtand, and directed to him alone, who ſtiles himſelf <hi>a God hearing Prayer,</hi> and in his <hi>Mediation,</hi> who is the true and only <hi>Mediatour,</hi> in whoſe name we are allowed, and commanded to ask, what we need; with aſſurance given, that it ſhall be granted. And what ever elſe that's requiſite to promote your <hi>Sanctification, Conſolation</hi> and <hi>Salvation,</hi> even all the means of Grace, which he hath appointed, that was <hi>faithful in all his houſe.</hi> A <hi>Mercy</hi> ſo invaluable, that all other mercies of Life and Health, of Peace and Plenty, are greatly inferiour to it, and nothing but <hi>Heaven</hi> it ſelf <hi>exceeds,</hi> or is above it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, You have ſtood a long time in this <hi>Vineyard,</hi> lived a great while in ſuch a <hi>Church.</hi> Not <hi>three years</hi> only, but more than <hi>three times three,</hi> yea <hi>threeſcore years</hi> many of you, and all of you many, tho not ſo many all. And know that the longer you have ſtood, and the oftner God hath come to look for Fruit, the greater your account will be, and the nearer cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:107489:194"/> down you are: and if you mend not if you repent not, now ſpeedily and throughly, the more ſudden, haſty, ſure, ſore, and dreadful will your cuting down be.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The more coſt and pain hath been beſtowed upon you, the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier, the ſtricter reckoning you muſt be called to, and the ſeverer vengeance will God inflict, if you continue to receive his Grace in vain, and with obſtinate ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity <hi>delay</hi> to bring forth <hi>Fruit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, If after long ordinary means injoyed, freſh alarms be given, and new and more vigorous calls and applications be made to you, by <hi>extraordinary diſpenſations</hi> of Gods Providence, and other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances he brings you under, which are like the letting it alone <hi>another year,</hi> after Sentence given to cut it down, for the three former years <hi>barrenneſs:</hi> and theſe be loſt, and prove as unſucceſsful as thoſe which went before them: then you <hi>periſh</hi> inevitably without remedy, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, or any pitty. For</p>
            <p>Firſt, God will do no more, <hi>It ſhall not be digged nor pruned any more,</hi> Iſa. v. 6. Whatever God doth, he doth with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his <hi>Mercy</hi> or his <hi>Juſtice,</hi> they are <hi>Principia imperantia in Deo,</hi> as the <hi>Schools</hi>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:107489:194"/> ſpeak; they engage, and ſet all his <hi>Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes</hi> on work, as his <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> &amp;c. and all he doth, is for the <hi>glory</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his <hi>Mercy</hi> or his <hi>Juſtice:</hi> and when neither of them can be farther glorified: then he <hi>ceaſes</hi> to work, and will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed no farther, do no more. And ſuch is the caſe here, neither of them would be glorified by his doing more for ſuch men: and therefore Mercy is not for it, and Juſtice is againſt it. His <hi>Mercy</hi> hath hath been hitherto <hi>glorified,</hi> in ingaging his <hi>Wiſdom</hi> to uſe ſuch variety of means and methods, to bring them to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and his <hi>patience</hi> in allowing ſo much time, to ſee what the <hi>effect</hi> would be; but to continue always to do ſo, and longer to do ſo, when abundantly enough hath been vouchſafed, to magnifie his Mercy, both in his <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and his <hi>Patience,</hi> he will then give over. And to go on ſtill; would but be to <hi>expoſe</hi> his <hi>Wiſdom</hi> to <hi>cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi> and his <hi>Patience</hi> to <hi>contempt.</hi> He will not be always trying <hi>concluſions</hi> in vain, and to no purpoſe, after he hath done abundantly enough to manifeſt, yea mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, his <hi>Mercy</hi> in the Eyes of all impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial witneſſes; and <hi>excuſe</hi> his <hi>Juſtice</hi> in what he ſhall inflict, by leaving them <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable,</hi> on whom he ſhall inflict it. As
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:107489:195"/> he <hi>ſaith</hi> to the incorrigible, <hi>Why ſhould you be ſtricken any more, you will revolt more and more.</hi> Iſa. i. 5. Seeing you are like the <hi>Anvil,</hi> which grows <hi>harder</hi> the more <hi>blows</hi> are laid upon it. So to the <hi>indocible,</hi> and <hi>impenitent,</hi> why ſhould ye be taught, called on, warned, reproved any more, ſeeing ye refuſe to learn, hearken, take warning and return? Why ſhould the <hi>Word of the Lord be precept upon precept, precept upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, line upon line, line upon line, to thoſe who have made a covenant with death, and are at an agreement with hell?</hi> Who have made <hi>Lyes their refuge, and have hid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under falſehood,</hi> unleſs that they might <hi>go, and fall backward, and be ſnared, and taken,</hi> Iſa. xxviii. 13, 15.</p>
            <p>And why any more <hi>vain endeavours</hi> to charm them, who have made themſelves like the <hi>deaf Adder which refuſeth to hear the voice of the charmer, charming never ſo wiſely,</hi> whoſe doom is therefore to be <hi>taken away ſuddenly, both living and in his wrath,</hi> Pſal. lviii. 4, 5, 9. Why any more <hi>Piping</hi> to them who will not <hi>Dance,</hi> or <hi>mourning</hi> to them who will not <hi>weep,</hi> Luk. vii. 32. Who will be won, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by <hi>promiſes</hi> nor <hi>threats,</hi> overcome neither by <hi>hopes</hi> nor <hi>fears,</hi> nor gained, as we ſay, either by fair means, or by foul.
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:107489:195"/> 
               <hi>How oft would I have gathered you as an hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not: ſuch ſhall be left deſolate,</hi> Luke xiii. He will not always <hi>Cluck</hi> them, nor offer them his ſhelter any more, thoſe whom he hath often called and they would not anſwer, he will call no more. Nay he will not anſwer when they call to him. Abuſed <hi>Patience</hi> will turn into <hi>Fury</hi> and 'tis fit <hi>Juſtice</hi> ſhould have its turn, and at length take place on them, who have long deſpiſed <hi>Mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, He can do no more. <hi>What could have been done more to my Vineyard, that I have not done in it?</hi> Iſa. v. 4. All hath been done, that <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Induſtry,</hi> and the beſt Husbandry can do; and all that, in that reſpect, it is capable of having done for it.</p>
            <p>The Scope of the <hi>Parable,</hi> is to ſhew the care and faithfulneſs of the <hi>Planter,</hi> and the <hi>Dreſſer</hi> of the <hi>Vineyard;</hi> to whom it belongs to give good <hi>Tillage</hi> and <hi>Culture,</hi> and to perform what's to be done below on Earth: but not to ſend Rain and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Weather, or the kind and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful influences of Heaven, and it muſt not be ſtretcht too far, nor applyed to the internal Operations of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Nor to limit the <hi>extraordinary</hi> power of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:107489:196"/> God: as if by his Almighty Grace, he could abſolutely have done no more, to make his <hi>Vineyard</hi> Fruitful. For in a <hi>Parallel</hi> caſe, we are told, <hi>He is able to raiſe children to</hi> Abraham, <hi>out of ſtones,</hi> and he that hath promiſed <hi>To take away the heart of ſtone, and give an heart of fleſh;</hi> muſt not be denyed Ability, to do it when, and for whom he pleaſeth.</p>
            <p>But it is to be reſtrained to, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of, the <hi>external</hi> means of Grace, and Gods <hi>ordinary</hi> power exerted in, and by them, And in as much, as no part or degree of them had been wanting, but all vouchſafed, that God <hi>ordinarily</hi> doth, or can afford: it is ſaid, he had done all he could. And poſſibly it may be thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt, tacitely to convince men, who are prone to think outward means alone <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient.</hi> And believe they can, by the help of them alone, <hi>turn to God,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>fruitful,</hi> if they pleaſe, and when they pleaſe. And are thereby left <hi>ſelf-condemned,</hi> becauſe God hath done his part, (and all themſelves eſteem needful) and they neglect their own; and perform not what they know they ought, and think they can.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, His <hi>Interceſſours</hi> deſire him to do no more but ceaſe, become ſilent, and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:107489:196"/> plead no longer. And you know when an <hi>Advocate</hi> yields and throws up his <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents</hi> Cauſe, he is in a ſad caſe, his buſineſs is loſt. 'Tis expreſs and plain in the <hi>Text</hi> if he will pleaſe to ſpare it another <hi>year,</hi> and beſtow more coſt and pains on it, hee'l ask no more; <hi>if it bear not fruit then, cut it down</hi> and ſpare not. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Chriſt</hi> in Heaven, nor his <hi>Miniſters</hi> on Earth, have one word more to ſay for a <hi>people</hi> whom neither <hi>ordinary,</hi> nor <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary</hi> means, will make better. 'Tis uſual to ask a Priſoner why Sentence ſhould not be given, and when neither he nor his <hi>Council,</hi> can alledg any, then <hi>Judgment</hi> is given, and <hi>Execution</hi> follows. So here when they who had pleaded for them, can plead, will plead no longer, becauſe they have no <hi>Plea</hi> left: then the Caſe is deſperate, there is no hope. As long as <hi>Abraham</hi> interceeded for <hi>Sodom,</hi> God granted what he <hi>requeſted.</hi> But as ſoon as he left, God procceeds to execute vengeance. When there is no man to make up the <hi>Hedg,</hi> or ſtand in the <hi>Gap</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God for the <hi>Land,</hi> that he ſhould not deſtroy it, then he pours out his <hi>indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> upon it, and <hi>conſumes</hi> it with the fire of his wrath. <hi>Ezech.</hi> xxii. 30, 31.</p>
            <pb n="80" facs="tcp:107489:197"/>
            <p>Fourthly, God himſelf forbids them to <hi>Pray</hi> for ſuch men. <hi>Pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, neither make interceſſion to me,</hi> Jer. vii. 16. Now conſider what <hi>people</hi> this was. Even the <hi>Trees</hi> of his own Planting in his own <hi>Vineyard.</hi> His own <hi>People</hi> who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt the true <hi>Religion,</hi> but abuſed that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,</hi> and made it a <hi>Cloak</hi> for their <hi>vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies.</hi> As if that pretext had given them a <hi>Licence</hi> to commit their Abominations. but the better their <hi>Religion,</hi> the worſe ſhall they ſpeed, who <hi>Prophane</hi> it, defile it, and by not bearing the <hi>genuine Fruits</hi> of it, but the contrary, cauſe it to be evil ſpoken of, and that God to be <hi>Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed,</hi> who was the <hi>Author</hi> of it. The whole place, tho exceeding appoſite to our purpoſe, is too large to be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed. <hi>Jer.</hi> vii. 4. to the 17. <hi>Truſt ye not in lying words ſaying the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord are theſe;</hi> this repeating it ſo often, ſhews the height of their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, but this will not do, unleſs they <hi>throughly amend their ways and doings.</hi>— then <hi>verſe</hi> 8. <hi>Behold you truſt in lying words, that cannot profit.</hi> This will not ſecure you, <hi>will ye ſteal, murder, commit adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery and ſwear falſly— and come and ſtand
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:107489:197"/> before me in this houſe, which is called by my name, and ſay, we are delivered to do al thoſe abominations. Is this houſe become a den of Robbers in your Eyes? But go to</hi> Shiloh <hi>and ſee what I did to them for their wickedneſs,</hi> and He do as bad, or worſe, to you for yours, <hi>Becauſe I ſpake to you riſing early, and you heard not, and I called and you anſwered not. Therefore I'le caſt you out of my ſight.</hi> Then follows <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pray not thou for them,</hi> &amp;c. As if he ſhould ſay to us, you mightily deceive your ſelves, and truſt in lying words, and which will not profit you, to have you ſpared: If you ſay, we are <hi>Baptiſed,</hi> we are true <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> we keep our <hi>Church,</hi> &amp;c. And think this will excuſe you, in the neglect of <hi>bearing</hi> the <hi>Fruits</hi> your <hi>Baptiſm</hi> obliges you to, and your <hi>Holy Religion</hi> exacts of you, and preſume to do quite contrary. And tho I have long lookt for better from you, and long called you to amendment, and have been intreated by my <hi>Servants</hi> to ſpare you, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and again, but I ſee 'tis all to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, therefore I am reſolved to ſpare you no longer, nay I charge all that love me, to ſpeak no more for you that you ſhould be ſpared. See alſo <hi>Jer.</hi> xi. 14, 17. Where we have the very Metaphor of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:107489:198"/> my <hi>Text, A green Olive-tree</hi> planted, but evil pronounced againſt it, by him that <hi>planted</hi> it, and prayer forbidden to be made for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> If they do <hi>pray</hi> for them he will not hear: he tells them ſo to ſtop their mouths: <hi>I will not hear thee,</hi> Ezek. 14.14. <hi>tho theſe three men, Noah, and Daniel, and Job ſtood before me, as I live, ſaith the Lord, they ſhould deliver neither ſon nor daughter.</hi> Such men, mighty in power, whom one would think ſhould obtain any thing, and God would deny them nothing, even they ſhould not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail for a people who had ſinned againſt God by treſpaſſing grievouſly, <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. had grieved him by long reſiſting his Calls, by impenitency; and had <hi>ſet up their idols in their hearts, and the ſtumbling block of their iniquity before their faces.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Nay, they who have <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded</hi> for you, that you might be ſpar'd; yea, and prevail'd for you, that you have been ſpar'd: will turn their <hi>prayers</hi> againſt you, if after all his ſparings of you, they ſee you will not turn to God, but continue obſtinate, they will pray God to rid his <hi>Church</hi> of you, as the <hi>bane,</hi> as the <hi>peſts</hi> of the place you live in, who by your bad <hi>example,</hi> and bad coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:107489:198"/> and other miſchiefs you do, hinder other ſinners from returning. How doth holy <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> who had ſtood before the <hi>Lord</hi> to <hi>ſpeak good</hi> for that <hi>people,</hi> at length not only deſiſt and ceaſe <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> for them; but <hi>chap.</hi> 11.20. cryes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, <hi>Let me ſee thy vengeance on them.</hi> And <hi>Eliah</hi> makes interceſſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Rom. 11.2. for their <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfulneſs,</hi> and corrupting their <hi>Religion:</hi> and when they who uſed to hold God's hands, and to whom he ſaith, <hi>Let me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone that I may deſtroy them,</hi> Deut. 9.14. not only let looſe his hands, but let looſe their own <hi>prayer</hi> againſt them. What ſhall become of ſuch a People?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Nay, your own <hi>mouths</hi> will be ſtopped, and you will be <hi>ſpeechleſs,</hi> and as before you had no heart to uſe the <hi>arguments,</hi> you might have pleaded for your ſelves, ſo now you will have no <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments</hi> to plead, nothing to ſay, but will be out of countenance, wholly, and quite aſhamed to hold up your heads be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God.

And they who have <hi>means</hi> to know God, and will not <hi>know</hi> him, and when they do know him, will not <hi>glorifie</hi> him, nor bring forth the <hi>Fruits,</hi> by which others might be provok'd to <hi>glorifie</hi> him, are without excuſe. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20.</p>

Conſider this, ye that forget God.</hi> And in the days of your <hi>youth,</hi> and health, and ſtrength go on ſecurely in the ways of your own hearts, and deſpiſe admonition and refuſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, and think in your ſelves, if you have but time to cry, <hi>Lord, have mercy upon me,</hi> at laſt, all ſhall be well, and you ſhall be as ſafe, as they that ſooneſt turn to God, and ſought him timely with

            <p>
               <hi>Ninthly.</hi> God will take away the very <hi>means</hi> from them who truſt in the formal cuſtomary fruitleſs uſe of them.

            <p>Thirdly, He declares himſelf willing to forget and forgive our paſt unfruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>if it bear fruit, well,</hi> yet, yet after ſo long bearing none, if yet at laſt it thrive, under this <hi>laſt tryal,</hi> and anſwer this <hi>new husbandry</hi> beſtowed upon it, it ſhall ſtand. <hi>He ſhall ſurely live, he ſhall not dy.</hi> God will <hi>blot out all your iniquities</hi> out of his remembrance. <hi>Waſh you, make you clean, put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes, ceaſe to do evil, learn to do well, come now let us reaſon together ſaith the</hi> Lord: <hi>tho your ſins be as ſcarlet they ſhall be as white as ſnow: tho they be red like crimſon, they ſhall be as wooll,</hi> Iſa. i. 16, 17, 18.</p>
            <pb n="101" facs="tcp:107489:207"/>
            <p>Fourthly, To aſſure our <hi>Faith,</hi> how all this may be done, and that it ſhall be done aſſuredly, he hath provided a ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for his <hi>own glory.</hi> That we may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain all this, and yet he <hi>loſe</hi> nothing, by conferring it upon us. Our <hi>Hearts</hi> would ſink, and fail within us, and our <hi>Hands,</hi> our <hi>Faith</hi> could not be ſtrong, if God were to <hi>loſe,</hi> by what we hope to <hi>gain.</hi> if the <hi>receiving</hi> us to <hi>glory,</hi> muſt be by the <hi>eclipſing</hi> of his <hi>own glory.</hi> For he will never <hi>diminiſh</hi> that, for the advancement of which, all things were made by him, and for the ſake of which, he doth all that he doth, or ever will do, that therefore his <hi>Mercy</hi> may be thus <hi>magnified</hi> ſafely, he hath provided how his <hi>Juſtice</hi> may be <hi>ſatisfied</hi> fully, and all his other <hi>Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes</hi> retain their luſtre and their bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. <hi>He hath</hi> therefore <hi>raiſed up for us a mighty ſalvation in the houſe of his ſervant</hi> David, <hi>as he ſpake by the mouth of all his</hi> Holy Prophets <hi>ſince the world began.</hi> And <hi>to give us the clear knowledge of ſalvation by the remiſſion of our ſins: through the tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of our God the day ſpring from on high hath viſited us.</hi> He hath deviſed <hi>means,</hi> to bring home his <hi>baniſhed,</hi> that they ſhould not for ever be <hi>expelled</hi> from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: that we may be delivered from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:107489:208"/> down to the pit. <hi>He hath found a ranſom. He hath laid help upon one that is mighty, able to ſave to the utmoſt, all thoſe that come to God by him. He ſpared not his own Son,</hi> but gave him to be a <hi>ranſom</hi> for us, made him to be ſin <hi>(that is a ſin offering)</hi> for us, <hi>that we might become the righteouſneſs of God in him,</hi> yea made him a <hi>curſe</hi> for us, bear that <hi>curſe</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> which we had deſerved, that we might be delivered from it. <hi>God hath ſet forth his Son</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>to be a propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation through faith in his blood.</hi> And he is gone into Heaven <hi>to appear in the preſence of God for us,</hi> ſo that <hi>if any man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>the righteous, who is a propitiation for our ſin;</hi> and therefore <hi>If we confeſs our ſins, he is faithful and juſt to forgive us our ſins, and the blood of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>his Son cleanſeth us from all ſin.</hi> And he hath revealed him to us, and publiſht theſe <hi>glad tidings</hi> to us in his <hi>Goſpel,</hi> which takes its name, its denomination hence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in it, and by it, is made known to us thoſe <hi>glad tidings</hi> of great joy, that the Son of God is become the Son of man, is now <hi>Emanuel, God with us,</hi> to be a <hi>Saviour</hi> to us.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, He makes us the moſt free, kind, pathetick <hi>invitations,</hi> to come to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:107489:208"/> him, to look unto him and be ſaved. He bids us to a <hi>Feaſt</hi> of <hi>fat things,</hi> which he hath ſlain and <hi>prepared,</hi> and of <hi>choice Wine, Wine upon the lees well refined.</hi> You ſhall ſcarce any where amongſt men, tho the deareſt to one another, and moſt delighted in each others converſation, meet with ſo paſſionate, ſo reſtleſs an importunity, as is expreſt to bring in Gueſts to the <hi>Wedding Feaſt,</hi> Matth. xxii. and Luk. xiv. Firſt a previous <hi>invitation</hi> before hand, then a <hi>liberal</hi> and ſumptuous <hi>preparation,</hi> which might allure any man to partake of it. Then a ſending forth ſervants to call them who were before bidden, then a ſending forth other ſervants to inform them, what an <hi>extraordinary entertainment</hi> was provided, and again to let them know, the meat was on the <hi>Table,</hi> and their <hi>Lord</hi> ſtaid for them, and would not ſit down till they were come: and then other <hi>ſervants</hi> are poſted away, ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Streets</hi> and <hi>Lanes</hi> of the <hi>City,</hi> to ſearch the very Lanes and by Allies where none but perſons of the meaneſt rank dwell or converſe; others into the <hi>Country,</hi> into the <hi>Highways,</hi> where may be met <hi>Paſſengers</hi> of all degrees and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: and to the <hi>Hedges</hi> where the <hi>Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> lye basking, or the <hi>Robbers</hi> lye ſculk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

And the whole Bible is, as it were concluded and ſhut up, with that large and free and earneſt <hi>invitation,</hi> which is ſo <hi>proclaimed,</hi> that the whole world is made to ring of it. He that hears firſt, as being neareſt to the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:107489:209"/> firſt ſound, having charge to tell it unto others, and call to them that are remote, and out of hearing of the firſt publiſhers of it. <hi>The Spirit and the bride,</hi> God from Heaven, the Church on Earth <hi>ſay come.

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:107489:210"/> peace and ſafety, God will <hi>plague</hi> that man: then <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. <hi>And if any man ſhall take away from the words of the Book of this Prophecy: God ſhall take away his part out of the Book of life, and out of the Holy City: and from the things which are written in this Book,</hi> that is, if any man ſhall deny any one to be capable of the <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit</hi> offered in this, ſo large and free, and univerſal, an <hi>invitation:</hi> who doth <hi>thirſt</hi> after theſe <hi>waters of life,</hi> and ſo thirſting, ſhall come to them, repenting and believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and willing and deſirous to drink of them.

               <hi>Sixthly.</hi> He that is the <hi>Amen, the true and faithful one,</hi> the <hi>God</hi> that cannot <hi>lie,</hi> gives you many great and precious <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,</hi> which are founded upon his word, that is more <hi>firm</hi> than the <hi>mountains:</hi> than the <hi>foundations</hi> of the <hi>Earth:</hi> than the <hi>Ordinances</hi> of Heaven: than the <hi>courſe</hi> of day and night in their Seaſons: <hi>That he will abundantly pardon, that he will heal your back-ſlidings, and love you freely;</hi> that he will <hi>blot out your iniquities, as a thick cloud;</hi> that he will <hi>caſt all your Tra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly.</hi> As if it were not enough on his part, to give us leave to be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, he hath made it our <hi>duty</hi> to be ſo, and obliged us by the ſtricteſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, to that, which will infallibly render us ſo. <hi>He commands all men eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where to repent.</hi> Act. 17.30. <hi>This is his commandment, that we believe on the Name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 John 3.23. <hi>and that believing we might have life by his Name.</hi> John 20, 31. And who dare queſtion his ſincerity? as if he did not heartily deſire, what he ſo earneſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eighthly.</hi> He ſteps down from the Throne of the <hi>Imperative Mood,</hi> to the humble <hi>Foot-ſtool</hi> of the <hi>Optative.</hi> 'Tis a ſign of weakneſs to fall to wiſhing, and an argument of impotence, to cry <hi>O ſi, O ſi!</hi> to ſigh out our <hi>Options.</hi> And yet the <hi>Omnipotent God</hi> diſdains not to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to us thus, to ſhew and expreſs the <hi>pathos</hi> of his bleſſed mind, the vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with which he deſires our good and wellfare: <hi>Oh that there were ſuch an heart in them,</hi> Deut. 5.29. <hi>Oh that they were wiſe,</hi> Deut, 32.29. <hi>Oh that my people had

Whoſe heart would it not break, with ſhame and ſorrow, to hear an holy God breathing out the longing deſires of his heart, in this wiſe, that we may he aſſured of his hearty readineſs in accepting us, when we perform, what he wiſhes with ſuch aſſumed <hi>paſſions,</hi> that we would perform?</p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>

            <p>This is a little of the much, that might be ſaid upon this <hi>Argument,</hi> a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of that mellow prolifick earth, to be laid to your Roots, God Almighty ſet it home by the hand of his own Spirit, and in his name I do aſſure you, if either this digging, or this dunging, theſe threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, or thoſe promiſes, either ſingly, or both joyntly, prevail to make you yet <hi>fruitful:</hi> God will aſſuredly ſpare you, and repeal his ſentence given out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you. But then you muſt do it quickly. <hi>Agree with thy Adverſary quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whilſt thou art in the way with him:</hi> Look upon this as the <hi>laſt</hi> year of Gods <hi>patience</hi>
